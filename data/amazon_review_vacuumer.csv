    Better than crosswave cordless max !
  
","









  
  
    
  Literally the best cleaning device ever! SO much better than the original crosswave or the cordless max. After cleaning the whole house the battery still had 30% left. Wiped the floor with a paper towel after to see and it was barely even dirty. Highly recommend !!!

  Works amazing for everyday cleaning of the hard floors we have! Doesn't work so great on the old laminate floors we have as they are more grooved but thats not the tinecos fault! Just crappy flooring. The clean water tank does leak UNLEES you actually push the floater down from inside the tank with something or your finger. Super annoying but still, once figured out, I can deal with it.

    A wonderful device that has brought back my sanity after toddler eating sessions

  This water vacuum replaces both a mop and vacuum cleaner when cleaning hardwood floors after toddlers eating, especially with any soupy foods and juice spills, there really is no replacement

  I love the idea of this vacuum/mop! The suction is great and it cleans up quickly. My problem is that if I don’t immediately clean the tank, the brush roller and the debris channel after each use, it smells awful!!! I want to be able to use it for quick clean ups and it’s definitely not quick if I have to deep clean the unit every time I use it.

    Beautiful floors! Wish it had a bigger DWT.

  The vacuum leaves my floors looking beautiful!  The smell of the cleaner is amazing.The only thing I wish is that it could go longer without needing to run a self cleaning cycle.  I clean the Family room, front room, kitchen and hallway regularly and I can only get halfway through before having to run self cleaning cycle.  I feel I need to order more filters since the instructions say that you are supposed to use a dry clean filter when using the vacuum.

  I’ve been wanting this vacuum/mop for a long time and am so happy with it. I absolutely dreaded mopping my floors before and now I actually enjoy it! I love knowing I’m not just pushing the dirt around like I was with my old mop. You can tell by the water, and the look of your floors, that they’re actually clean! It is so light weight and easy to use. Really an amazing product.

  This wet mop/vacuum is amazing!! Well worth the price! My floors have never looked so clean!! I struggled to find the right wet mop to use on our hard wood floors.

    Absolute nightmare
  
","









  
  
    
  First of all, the worst app ever! It is an absolute nightmare to register it through the app. Took 5 tries to get it to work. Second, you can only use it on non-carpet floors! Only hardwood floors, tile, etc. There’s no regular vacuum feature for carpet areas. There’s no tools to use for hard to reach areas. You have to clean the brushes after EVERY single use. If you’re trying to do a quick floor clean and be done, it will affect its useful life to not clean the brushes. Kinda defeats the purpose of easy quick floor cleaning. Do yourself a favor and do not buy this headache.

Super happy with that, being that was my biggest worry with this cleaner. I also have 3 shedding cats/dogs in our home. It picks up the hair with no problem with a twice a week vacuuming.  It does not do well on my area rugs or stairs. I still use the traditional vacuum for those areas. Love that my floors are not only vacuumed, but also clean at the same time.

  As a very busy mom of 2 little ones, pets, and my whole house being hardwood floors, I was SO excited to get this vacuum to cut my floor cleaning time in half. After a few short months of using it, I’ve noticed that it leaves a lot of dirt/dust behind. Also, Not even a full minute into cleaning my floors, it will inform me to set it on the charger and to run the self cleaning cycle even after Ive taken it apart and cleaned it by hand as well as replacing the filter & roller. I also never put any other solution into it besides the Tineco solution so I have no idea what could be going on with it. For what I paid for this, I expected a much better product and I truly regret purchasing it. I will just stick the good old fashioned mop and bucket!

  This product is great. I already have three vacuums. My friend bought this one and said it fantastic. So I give it a try. It's totally worth the money.

Also it does not take much effort to clean the machine. It has auto cleaner.

  The most impressive thing about this was that I tested the highest traffic area of my house (by the back door, doggie door and dog water/food bowls) with a single pass followed up by scrubbing a few tiles with a damp paper towel to find nearly nothing on the paper towel.It is so fast and easy to use and I don’t care what kind of mess my kid or dogs make on the floor because I know it will be a quick clean up.I refer to this as my baby and my son may feel slightly offended but some day he will understand

  So I have all hardwood floor in my house but one, I have a dog, two kids and a husband who loves to hunt.. which means they’re constantly tracking things in my house! It works so well and doesn’t leave any drops of water like the crosswave did. The only thing I didn’t like is I wish it got closer to the wall (leaves about a once inch gap) and the water tank held more.. but these are minor compared to the wonderful job it does. I have used it everyday since I received it. 100% recommend. If it breaks I will buy another..

  I was so excited to order and receive this item. As soon as it arrived I went to work only to be highly disappointed. I started using the item and of course it needed to be charged two minutes after starting so I put it to charge. Then the item continued saying to change the water when the water was clean and I had just put the water. Once it finally charged I started using it again on the floor. After I was done with the hardwood floor I noticed streaks on the floor from what appeared to be the wheels on the vacuum. I went over the floor again only to see the same streaks again. Needless to say I am not impressed with this item.

  Let me start with a tip. Remove the cardboard from the rotary brush before use! That being said let me talk about all of the fantastic features this floor cleaner has. Yes, $400 is pricey. That is more than I spent on my carpet vacuum, but this comes with a pretty big bottle of cleaner. You only need a cap full. It comes with an installed HEPA filter and an extra. It also come with an installed brush and an extra. It also comes with a cleaning wand that has a couple uses. And, it talks to you! I really like that it doesn't soak my floors as it cleans. It doesn't spray out water. You don't even have to push or hold down a button to operate it. It just keeps the rotary brush damp and sucks up the dirty water as you push it along the floor. The whole thing is really pretty light, much lighter than my carpet vacuum. The first charge lasted long enough to clean my 10x10 kitchen floor and my master bathroom with battery to spare.

  Super lightweight and whisper quiet. Cleans and polishes floors nicely. There is a little bit of a learning curve when it comes to maintaining/cleaning the machine properly, but once you’ve done it a couple of times it becomes much easier than the hassle of vacuuming and then using a traditional mop.Strongly suggest either using the included cleaner or finding a floor cleanser that does not create excess foam when agitated. If you use a foamy cleanser it will fill up the dirty water tank very quickly.Overall the purchase was totally worth it and my floors have that soft glow after each use!

  It seems like a plastic toy but it really works.  It is not a 2 for 1.  You must sweep or vacuum before using it for mopping because it clogs easily, stops working, and creates a spilling mess.

  What a headache this thing is. It starts off great. But then after a couple of months things start going wrong. Maybe you just emptied the dirty water tank - well one minute in it starts telling you to clean the dirty water tank or debris channel and shuts down and there is nothing you can do.

  I have wanted one of these for years. I am overall really happy with it. The cleaning is great, its easy to use, light weight. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is the water tank and dirty water reservoir is way to small. I have a very small house and I can only do my small living room and bathroom before it needs to be dumped. Doing the whole house I have to dump it twice. Then when it's on the cleaning cycle to clean itself I have to dump it once if not twice more. That's kinda annoying but it cleans very well. We have wood tile throughout our home.

  So, I have kids and dog. This has definitely lighten my work load. Wonderfully easy to use, and clean, does an excellent job on my area rugs as well as tile, and linoleum. I agree with other reviews, its not good for that deep clean, but it makes sweeping/moping so much easier, it can be a daily task easily. Also makes quick work of those little kid (and puppy) spills and messes. Its quieter than I expected and self clean and cordless makes all the difference. Will update review as time goes on, but if your looking for a vacmop, this is one, imo

  So far, this vacuum is absolutely amazing! JUST what I was hoping for. No more getting down on my hands and knees to scrub the floors! We live in a very rural part of the mountains, and dirty floors are always an issue with kids, the dog, etc. Life is messy! I really like the cordless feature. The vacuum also guides itself and is very easy to use. Quick setup upon arrival as well. I'm loving this vacuum! I sure hope it holds up, and continues to perform like it does now. I've been telling everyone I know about it. Money well spent.

   Contacting customer service AGAIN! I'm on my second machine, they replaced the first on about a year ago, and not the replamwnt one stopped working too.This does not replace a mop or steamer for real cleaning, it just good for quick cleaning and daily upkeep. I still have to mop on the weekend and steam about once a month. I have Smartcore LVP flooring with smooth texture and slight beveled edges.

  I've used this twice. Yesterday, I cleaned the kitchen, living room, dining room, 2 halls, big master and BIG master bath, 2 other bathrooms, and laundry room. It took me 35 minutes. I used 3 caps full of detergent (3 clean water tanks worth). Had to empty the dirty water twice. And the floor was the cleanest ever. Mops just move stuff around sometimes. Messy to clean but worth it. Will never sweep and mop again. Hope the quality is good.. cuz I love this.

  I received this as a Christmas present and just recently tried to register it. I had problems registering it. The support person for this product responded quickly but I’m old so I called my youngest daughter and she got it done for me. The support person was very nice and helpful. I used my vacuum cleaner for the first time yesterday and it was awesome. It’s easy to maneuver and very light weight and cleaned my kitchen floor better than any other cleaner I have used. It cleaned the  tough spots on my hard wood floors with ease. I would highly recommend this product.

  I've only written two other reviews, which were google reviews, so it goes to show how much I like the Tineco Floor One S3. It's easy to unpackage and put together and easy to use. It's also lightweight and self propelling. It makes cleaning so much fun that my 9 and 5 year old boys are excited to keep their room clean so they can use the new vacuum/mop (of course with adult supervision because this thing isn't cheap!). Every room in my home has wood flooring. I tried the Bissell Crosswave, but it was too loud and left a lot of water on the floor after mopping, so it was returned.  With the Tineco, I can clean every room with one charge, it's fairly quiet, and doesn't leave a lot of water on the floor, which makes minimal drying time. Great product. I hope it lasts a lifetime.

   Love! This product. Easy to clean after use. At $300 it was a bit much for me to spend. But it is so nice to just run underneath the kids seat after dinner or meal time and it picks up everything!!! Leaves the floor clean. Only drawback I have is that it doesn't get right next to the baseboard. But only like a half inch of space.  If you're deep cleaning this would be great to run over top first and last. Overall, we use it everyday. Does not need a lot of solution. The battery lasts me about an hour of straight use. It does also charge pretty fast. It's not recommended to use on carpet, but it does also get up small stains. Comes with an extra filter but not an extra roller. If you plan on using it everyday I would recommend getting extra.

    BEST VACUUM EVER - WHY DID I WAIT SO LONG
  
","









  
  
    
  The only question I'm asking myself is: Why did I wait so long to buy this??????BUY THIS NOW.  ADD TO CART. I LOVE IT.  I can't believe I am in totally head over heels for a wet/dry vac, but I seriously am.  Highlights:1.  It almost pulls itself.  My back didn't hurt ONCE and I did my entire house.2.  It's so easy to use and operate, my kids could (and WILL) do it!3.  It has amazing suction power.  AMAZING.  Dirt my vacuum missed was sucked right up.4.  You can see the results.  As a type A person, this was hugely rewarding (and also super gross)5.  It is actually quite cute and well designedCons: Nothing. It's perfect.

","









  
  
    
  I've always hated the work involved with mopping. From digging out the mop bucket, filling it with water and solution and lugging around the bucket around while I do the job. I used to mop MAYBE once a month, now I'm running the Tineco every other day or so. This thing is so much easier and really simple to use. I especially love that I don't have to sweep the floor prior to mopping since it can also vacuum. Very well worth the time it saves.Cleaning it is a bit tedious, but still overall a much better experience than using a regular old mop. It also dries much faster since it doesn't leave as much moisture on the floor even after several passes. The dirty water tank fills up fairly quickly, so sometimes I have to dump it out before I finish cleaning all of my floor. Using this in addition to a robovac is keeping my tile floor clean all the time.

  I got this after days of going back and forth with Bissel and hoover. I laid my hard wood floor back in 1999 or so. I went out and got the big bucket and cotton mop and light wet mopped my floors once a week sometime 2 weeks depending on how busy my life was at the time. I decided on the Tineco floor one S3.I was both amazed and disgusted of the dirty water tank that came from my floors. If you think your floors are clean after years of using a mop and bucket, they are not! This thing works and is worth the money is spent ($279). Installing the tanks takes practice but overall, I give it a 5. I will check back in after I've had it a few months to see how it holds up material wise.

It used to take me 3hrs to mop/dry my apartment’s hardwood floors from start to finish. With this cleaner, I can do the same job in an hour. The only drawback is you don’t get that freshly cleaned pine sol smell like with the mop. But that’s probably better for my lungs anyway. Can’t comment on deep cleaning as my place wasn’t nasty to begin with. Overall I’m happy with the performance of this cleaner. Wholeheartedly recommend.

I’ve done this so many times I’ve lost count. It’s been 3 weeks and I still haven’t got a replacement or anything to help get this resolved. I have never seen a company not send out a new product immediately if it’s still under warranty. The fact it only lasted a year is very worrisome for the price you pay for it.

  This machine is wonderful, and the only bad review I’d have to say is that it doesn’t get close to the wall or furniture. I wish they made a tool you could use to get the crevasses. Also, the water tank and dirty water tank get some use to putting themBack into there compartments. Other than that it’s an amazing machine and cleans beautifully.

    Broken after 8 months

  The Tineco IFloor 3 was much better than the Bissell we had but the Tinecos water pump broke after 8 months of use. There is no one who will work on the unit and the company wants you to ship it back for repairs which does not work for me since we use it constantly. I did order another unit after I tossed this one in the trash but if this one does not last more than a year I would not recommend their products.

  I love not having to sweep before I mop. This does a great job and gets the floors really clean.  My only complaints are there is a bit of a gap between the wall and where mopping ends and the water reservoir is on the smaller side and sometimes needs to be changed mid mop. It does a great job cleaning up after a malamute and keeping all the dog hair off the floor. Overall l, I love it and it cuts my cleaning time in half.

  I am so pleased with this little machine! Yes, I have to refill it often but that's why it's so light, and I'm able to mop my stairs.  Yes, I have to clear the debris channel and empty the dirty water tank often so I'm careful about what it sucks up.  Whenever possible, I vacuum first and it is just is such a pleasure to use!  I would never use it to mop us dirty spills, wipe it up first or you will have to clean the many parts of the machine.5 Stars compared to other electric mops I've used.

  I have loved the crosswave for a long time and have several of them but they’ve been disappointing me lately. This is easier to use and clean and cleans so much better.

  I bought this thinking it would be so superior to the cross wave and boy was I wrong. It just pushed larger debris all over. We use paper cat litter so the pellets get all over the hard floor. The cross wave sucks them right up. This won’t even touch it. Cereal? Nope. Larger pieces of anything? Nope. I essentially wasted hundreds of dollars on something I’ll have to resell for half the price. I’m so disappointed. After reading the reviews on here I was so sure that it would be the best thing ever. It is absolutely not. And you can quite literally stare at the battery just draining as fast as can be. Very misleading reviews. I hope to save someone from making the same mistake. Go get a cross wave. They’re superior in every way.

  Ok I am a busy mom with a teenage son and two dogs. This thing has been a game changer for my life....GAME CHANGER..... I was hesitant to spend this much money on something. I don’t have any carpet and I really like to go over my floors daily vacuuming. I have one dog that sheds a little (Frenchie) and I have teenagers running in and out of my house. I can clean my entire floors in 30-40 min. I do have to stop and refill the water and clean the brush but that is so much that a mop bucket and changing the water, but it does not run out of battery life. I feel like I’m still going to have to deep mop every once in awhile but this machine has literally changed my life because. My son can use. It’s super user friendly.

It’s not always possible to vacuum and mop everyday.

  I wish I bought this product years ago! As a college student living in a loft with a dog, I love being able to pick up pet hair and get the entire floor clean in one trip around the house. I’m very pleased that the suction power has no issue against the piles of dog hair hidden in tight spaces. It leaves the floor streak free with all messes gone, and it doesn’t use a ton of water so it practically dries as you go. I’m obsessed the self cleaning feature, it’s very satisfying to see the dirt lift right out.  The overall look of the model is pleasing enough to keep the battery port/unit itself out in my living space. The only negative thing I could see using this product is the fact that it has two settings that one could say has limited usage time-wise: firstly, the eco mode (25 minute run time) and secondly, the max mode (18 minute run time). I have no issue with this as I live in a small apartment, but big houses would potentially require to recharge in order to cover the entire area.

  I used to hate having to mop/scrub our tile floors, our house is just under 2000 sq ft.  With the Tineco Floor One S3, I've been doing my floors every week.  The Tineco is so easy to use and does a great job.  I showed it to my friend and she bought one the next day.  Love it!!!

    Amazing vac
  
","









  
  
    
  Great vacuum, sucks up decently large debris. I've used it and done a wipe test with a paper towel and spray to see if it missed anything. Nothing missed. Only gripe is, my floors are so dirty (have 2 dogs), that I need to click the self clean button a few times before the roll is clean again. But no biggie. I'm just always amazed by how much dirt this thing finds.

    Where have you been all my life?

  Just the cleaning tool I have been waiting for.  I like the dual tanks so I am always using clean water.  I used it on ceramic tile, laminate tile and sealed hardwood floors.  I was embarrassed by the amount of dirt there was in the dirty water tank.The only thing I would change is the size of the clean water tank and length of time on one charge.  I just plan my cleaning so I can put it on the charger intermittently.Highly recommend this product.

    Better than Bissell
  
","









  
  
    
  If you’re on the fence between Bissell and Tineco, Tineco wins. Great suction, easy to clean but has a small water tank that requires refilling often if you’re cleaning a large house. Not a bad trade-off for this quality product. Would definitely purchase again, perhaps the upgrade.

  I love this machine! It cleans up just about anything my kids are laying down. It vacuums and mops easily and quickly. I love the auto detection mode that tells me if I need to go over the area a few more times. Works great on my linoleum as well as my laminate hardwood. I do wish the clean water reservoir was bigger. I have to fill it three times to do my kitchen, dining room and foyer.Also wish the head got closer to edges. It leaves about a 1/4 along the baseboard.

  I love this thing more than my husband. It saves me so much time cleaning my LVP floors. It is a dream to use...cordless, lightweight, cleans itself, self propelled, and talks to you (with the ability to turn the talking off). It cleans amazingly well. The only cons are the small water canisters. I do have to refill/empty them a few times during a whole house clean (2300 sqft) but it takes all of 10 seconds to do. I will continue to buy TINECO products (I have a cordless vac as well) and rave about them to all my friends. Don’t hesitate to purchase. You won’t be disappointed.

    Doesn’t last through the 2 year warranty.
  
","









  
  
    
  So excited and loved it the minute I got it. 18 months in had a motor malfunction sent back to tineco they fixed that sent it back to me but now battery doesn’t charge I took it out of the box and the battery wasn’t working immediately and had to send it back again. Not worth the $300 I paid for it to not last through the warranty and it takes a month between shipping it to them and fixing and them shipping it back for it to still not work and send it back again.

  This was the best thing ever for about 2 months. I wrote customer service to let them know the machine stopped working - (suctioning and charging) and found out I can’t call, I can only email. They walked me through self help steps, and after about 2 weeks of that, determined I needed to send it in. The repair process was supposed to take 3 days. I got my machine back today after having been repaired, only to find out it still doesn’t work.

  Love love love my tineco. I usually run it on my floors 2-3 times a week. And vacuum with my bissell for my carpets. The suction is great! I love that it’s cordless and it does a great job on LVP. It’s relatively easy to clean out but you have to do it with every use. It’s not something you can just leave ready to roll when needed. It is great for kids messes, dog hair and even construction dust as we have settled into a new home. Worth every penny!

  I absolutely love my Tineco ifloor3!! The only reasons I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of how tiny the dirty water tank is and how quick it fills up and how frequently the auto clean indicator pops up.

  I raved about this product at first- thought it was the best thing we have purchased in a long time. 3 months of using it and it’s “okay”.. it only lasts about 5 full minutes before the auto clean button flashes, then you have to put it back on the charger where it uses almost all over your water and solution.. then you have to fill it back up again and it only runs another 10 or so minutes before the DWT is full or the battery dies. It cleans well... but it very inconvenient how often you have to fill the water tank, auto clean and then empty the tank. For the money $$, I don’t think it is it worth it.

  The is not it’s all cracked up to be. If you have pets you will need pre vacuum your floors prior to using this vacuum. Also depends on home size the water reserve is not very big so you are constantly having to fill the holding tank. Very upsetting for the price.

    Wonderfully disgusting

  Let me start by saying I live in the greater Portland OR area.  Beginning in October my backyard is a mud bowl.  Add to that two dogs (One, a 16-week old mud-loving Golden-Doodle) and you are set up for CONSTANT cleaning of the floors.  I bought this on impulse because I could barely keep up with daily sweeping, vacuuming, and mopping.  I am amazed.  I pick up the minefield of dog toys scattered about and within about 30 minutes my floors look amazing!  I am disgusted by the dirt, debris, and gunk this sweetheart pulls up every time I use it!The first time I used it the floors were streaky and so so.  I think it took a few cleanings for all of the preexisting dirt to come up.  I also slowed down a wee bit and figured out the pattern of ""push to vacuum, pull to mop"" Now I am simply amazed and I am so glad I got this tool.  The ONLY downside that I have discovered so far is that it does not truly mop to the edge.  About 1.5 cm from the edge is as good as it gets.

    JUST BUY IT! BEST DECISION EVER

  When I say I am impressed, I am not joking! This thing is AMAZING. My floors are now effortless to clean. I’ve seen lots of reviews for this bad boy compared to another certain brand (Bissel) and let me just say this one is the one to go with. It’s so easy to use and so easy to clean. I have previously used a spin mop, steam cleaner, swiffer, scrubbed on my hands and knees and NOTHING compares to the TineCo. I cleaned my floors in about 15 minutes, did the wipe check, and it was completely clean. What’s more impressive is the fact I did a quick clean with it only doing one pass and it was spotless. The water in the tank was absolutely disgusting, it was great. It did the job better than I could imagine. I’m so happy that I don’t ever have to sweep and regular mop again spending more than an hour on my floors. The only thing I can say could be improved is that it doesn’t get close to the wall - It leaves about an inch boarder, but that is such a minimal issue to me. This machine is worth all the money!

  I have to agree with many of the reviews here.  This iFloor 3 is a great model to have.  It gets the job done, saves me so much time, and makes me feel better about the cleanliness of my floors.  I was using one of those old familiar spray the floor, wipe with a pad style cleaners (I'm sure you know the one) and it was leaving streaks and just basically smearing all over the place if you tried to tackle anything major.  I have a kitty who's a litter tracker and often steps in piles of urine before making a dashed escape.  This machine has changed our daily routine so much!  No more on hands and knees with microfiber to make up for what the other wetjet type device did.  (oops I said part of the name)  My iFloor 3 has a great swivel handle that compares to my dyson vac which is great for turning corners.  I will say that it does not get as close to wall edges as I like but rarely do I need to get that close... most messes are splat right in walking paths.  I was looking for a device that had a separate clean versus dirty water tank, got it!  I was looking for something cordless that wouldn't run out while I was mid-cleaning, got it!  I was looking for something that could self-clean at the touch of a button, got it!  My only suggestion to the company would be to make it suction when pulling back not pushing forward as I would prefer to work my way out of a room instead of forward having to step over damp floors.  I would still purchase this again either way.  It's great!

    Better than the Crosswave?
  
","









  
  
    
  I had to buy another machine because my Bissell Crosswave stopped spinning (after only 3 months) and Bissell haas had my machine in the service for more than a month and they still tell me to wait to be contacted and I need a machine. I am very pleasantly surprised. The design in general is superior? The brush in this one doesn't have the hard ones the bissell has and I liked those. Also it doesn't quite sit straight. But the dirty water thingy doesn't give me the ""dirty"" message as often as the crosswave did. Also the floors seem clean but also pretty dry, compared with the Crosswave that wouldn't suck the water very well. The self cleaning feature seems a little long but it gets the job done. I will update in the future in case I have problems, but so far, I am very happy.

  Stopped working after 3 months. Contacted the manufacturer directly and they promised to replace it. I sent them my broken vacuum and 3 weeks later received a replacement. It was not what I was expecting. Replacement was another used vacuum. They didn’t even bother cleaning it, there was still dirty hair/water in the reservoir and the brush was black. The company keeps telling me they will replace it but it’s been over a month and still nothing.Called Amazon- explained our situation and they have issued me a refund.Will not buy anything else from Tineco ever again

  The suction power does pick up most things. There was this little piece of foam small and flat. I tried sucking it up in the ifloor, it picked it up or so I thought then it didn't, and did that several times but it did not suction it up. I just picked it up and moved on. That was only one time. Other than that I haven't had any problems with this and overall love this vacuum. It moves it itself, of course with directional motivation from you, but you don't have to use muscle. You really shouldn't because I did and hit a chair and it sounded like it was dying a little. So becareful to not run it hard into furniture. You don't really have to use any muscle to push it. It's awesome that it is self cleaning. Also the deodorizer/cleaner it comes with, last for a while instead of being gone in one clean. You only need one tiny capful per water fill. You can see all the dirt that it cleans up and of course it cleans up after itself, which is pretty sweet. All in all I'm pretty happy with it.

    Worth every penny
  
","









  
  
    
  The Tineco Floor One S3 Smart Cordless Wet Dry Vacuum Cleaner is by far, the best small appliance purchase I've made in years.As a frugal person, it was a difficult purchasing decision (making such a large investment) but it was definitely worth every penny. (I mean honestly, it's a lot of money for a mop.) Considering I used birthday gift cards to make my purchase, it helped offset my buyer's anxiety.But don't be deceived, this 'simple' mop is anything but: it's multi-talented and makes cleaning incredibly easy and dare I say...kinda fun.  First, let me talk advantages: The Tineco Floor One S3 is so convenient to use because of its sleek design. I can grab-and-go for quick cleanups or take my time with an all-over cleanup and not get an arm workout. Also, the sleek design makes it easy to lift, carry, and maneuver while cleaning so it really does require little effort on the user’s part. The fun aspect of using the Tineco S3 has actually encouraged participation from my family to help get the floors clean.The fact that this device vacuums AND mops at the same time is also incredible. It's nice that you don't have to do a heavy vacuuming before mopping. I researched other mops and I really wanted one that could vacuum and mop simultaneously and the Tineco S3 has figured it out. Also, with a rotating cleaning brush, I rarely need to run the device over a stubborn spot more than two times.A game-changer for me was the cordless feature. I honestly was skeptical that I would get any good cleaning results, but I am a true believer in the Tineco S3 after seeing that a cordless floor cleaner can keep up with the corded guys and the Tineco S3 has got the corded floor cleaners beat; I’m not wasting time unwrapping/rewrapping power cords just to clean up a small spill.On the downside: Some users may find the AI verbal commands a little annoying, however, they do sometimes come in handy when the user is doing something wrong; the Tineco voice will explain the necessary correction and get the user back on track. The AI also handles the self-cleaning mode with ease (along with user assistance) albeit with the robotic voice commands.Another downside is the Setup and User Manual. Don’t expect to have detailed instructions to clarify some of the features. (Honestly, who reads those nowadays?) Just about everybody wants a “Quick Start Guide” and then leave the detailed User Manual for troubleshooting. But be prepared to use your noggin’ to figure out some of the setup and features, but once you figure it out, you’ll be on your fun-loving, floor-cleaning way.

    I really tried to love this product
  
","









  
  
    
  As the title suggest, I wanted to really like it. I tried to test it against a variety of conditions and standards in my household, but ultimately it fell short of my expectations.The idea behind this product is versatile and handy, but the execution just leaves more to be desired.Here are a few key points to consider about this product from my personal experience:1.  The product leaves streaks on laminate flooring which really detracts from that clean floor feeling.2. The product has a very short battery life so it works best in small spaces. For larger spaces, anticipate waiting on charge times.3. It doesn’t work well as a deep clean product because it cannot get the edges. You can have the best vacuum/mop tool, but if it can’t get everything… what’s the point? So after a full cleaning with this product, I still have 10% of flooring that needs to be manually cleaned.4. This product is smart, but that can be a bit annoying. After each use, I would put it back on the charging block. The product would then run its self clean cycle and without fail, I must “clean the dirty water tank and clear the debris channel.” Great idea, but sometimes you just want to clean and go. It’s meant to be a quick clean up after all. You need to listen to the instructions however because should you neglect to clean it after each use… the tank will smell so horrid it will belong in the cesspool.5. The self clean ability is interesting and does a decent job of cleaning components. I have noticed however that it requires a deeper clean and I have not yet figured out how to do this. Without a deeper clean, I notice a weird smell coming from the product when in use.  My only solution so far has been to run the self clean cycle multiple times.6. You have to remember that although it can vacuum and mop, it utilizes the same tank. So you might not want to vacuum every little thing you see because you will quickly obstruct the debris channel and have to clean it out before continuing use.7. You can only use a specific cleaning solution.8. The solution tank and dirty water tank are not that big, but then again, you don’t use an absurd amount of solution.Overall, I think this product is best marketed to a single bachelor or maybe someone is a small apartment. This is definitely not a product for someone with kids and pets. Personally, I don’t think it’s worth the money nor would I be quick to give up my vacuum, broom or mop after purchase. Handy tool though… sometimes.

   Everyone has been raving about their Tineco or Bissell Crosswave.... so I HAD to get one.  I did my read watch, watched comparison videos, and read reviews.  Several of the videos showed the Tineco cleaning better than the Crosswave.  After using each they would wipe with a paper towel and the Crosswave left stuff behind, the Tineco did not, the paper towel was clean.  That was my decision maker.... and I am so happy with my purchase!The machine itself is so lightweight (lighter than my cordless Dyson) and it maneuvers easier too!  My 4 year old uses my Tineco with ease!I have 3 kids, 2 dogs, and 2 cats.  My kids don’t spill a ton of liquid or sauce (luckily). So I can’t really say how it does on those from experience (in the videos it cleaned those excellently).  For our family it is a huge time saver and does a better job than when we would sweep and mop.  Our cats’ litter box is in the laundry room in which our kids clean daily.  Before the Tineco they would sweep (they are long hair cats so hair is everywhere plus litter is spread around) then mop with a standard wet mop pad.  Since they have started using the Tineco they can sweep and mop in one step.  Plus it’s A LOT cleaner!  We have found the room actually doesn’t need cleaned as often because it just does a better job.We have bamboo flooring.  It saves me a step to sweep and mop in one step.  Like I said, I have kids and pets.... I don’t have time to sweep and mop all the time.I love that it is easy to dump out and then self cleans!  As I mentioned my kids use it everyday.  They dump out the dirty water tank and do the self cleaning on their own.My only complaint (which isn’t really a bog deal) is that we have to fill the clean water tank a lot; that water doesn’t last long.  We use it a lot so it’s not a big deal but if I had to list one thing that isn’t perfect about it, it would be that.Overall, my Tineco is a life saver!

  I researched for about 2 months before deciding to drink the Kool-Aid & purchase this. Floors look great, they also dry impressively fast, & the solution smells awesome. BUT after all is said & done, the self cleaning has a few drawbacks. You still have to take everything apart bc dog hair (I have 2), dirt, & sand still get stuck inside and all over the base it goes on. This is all after you’ve taken it apart to clean it in order to prep it for the self clean. Last thing & this may be reaching but I wish it had the ability to heat the water/ have a steam option. I feel like it’d have a better deep clean feel.

  This has changed my life in terms of cleaning. I hate washing the floors, so it was absolutely worth the purchase. The only things negative to note: The suction is pretty good, but it tends to blow things around. It does not get to the edge of my floor. It leaves about an inch. Lastly, the dirty and clean water tanks are small so I have to change them frequently within the same session.

  This has been a great addition to our Northwest home. We have dogs and lots of pine trees so mopping at least weekly is a necessity. This turns my weekly sweeping then mopping my main floor into a twenty minute thing instead of an hour. It sometimes leaves things, like tree sap, but that's difficult even by hand. It's easier to spot on a clean floor after using this machine. We really appreciate it.

Missed the return window and cannot get through to support on the number Tineco has listed. Guess I will leave an email and wait!!! I will not be recommending this product or their customer service to anyone. Steer clear.

    Very good machine but short battery life is a frustration.
  
","









  
  
    
  I like the efficiency of the machine that does both mopping and vacuuming at the same time however I wish the battery was better. It cleans the floor very well, but it's not able to get all the way to the edge, so that leaves a small area to do manually. It is difficult to only have enough battery life to get through part of the house then have to charge for 4 hours before I can finish. It would be nice if the battery could last at least 40-45 minutes instead of 20-25 on eco mode. Overall I am happy with it though. I think it will save me time in the long run.

  I’ll never do business with Tineco again! The product only last one month and then the charging base and or the unit dies. I’ve purchased three of their vacuum cleaner mops the one floor S3, and the i floor and all three of them have failed. Not to mention when trying to work with their customer service, their customer service is in China and their warehouse is in some other location. They have no way to contact via phone their warehouse when I have tried desperately and waited over 40 days to try to get a replacement charging base. Calling and emailing them every single week for 40 days and all they can say is that they’re sorry. This unit does not work if it cannot be charged via battery charging unit making a $400 investmentCompletely worthless. All three charging units on all three mop vacuums have failed and two of those the actual unit it’s self failed. The worst company to do business with that I’ve ever in my life experienced and I’ve experienced some bad things. I’ll never do business with TINECO again I am left now with a $400 piece of plastic that I can’t use. And I can’t get my money back.

   My Ifloor3 worked great for about 10 min. After that it started spazzing out. Water leaked everywhere. It wouldn't do a full self-clean and all the water would empty on the floor. It would say the dirty water tank was full while it was completely empty. The next day I went to try it and it did nothing.  I've been trying to call tineco for over a week and I've been emailing.  Their customer service is straight garbage. I spoke to 1 person for less than a minute so told me to email.  You get one correspondence every other day asking for more information and videos. They just give you the run around.  I'm beyond disappointed. I was looking forward to loving this machine.

  What a great product!  My 2 dogs are constantly tracking GA red clay into the house (and on my white tile floors). This has made vacuuming and cleaning my floors so much easier. It does a good job of getting up that mud and dirt. And it is very to easy to use and clean. I’ve never had an issue with the battery life and am able to complete all of my floors on one charge.Before ordering the Tineco floor cleaner I had researched other products.

My only complaint is how frequently you have to clean it, to keep it from stinking and working really well but it’s a tiny inconvenience, that just comes along with the maintenance.

  First off. I’ve had this a little over a month and every time I use it, I’m very happy.1. It does suck up Legos so make sure you don’t dump the container down the sink before removing legos2. You do not need to sweep your floors first, however I noticed that on the times I don’t sweep first, I have to charge it in the middle of my first floor wash. I also have to change the water container 4 times.  On the times I pre sweep… I don’t have to charge it and I only had to refill the water container 2 times.  First floor is about 1500 sq feet.My favorite feature it how the light turns a red color when the area is extra dirty.I’m happy I bought this. Very simple to set up and to clean and to store.

  Absolutely love this thing! I am currently 6 months pregnant and cleaning my hardwood tile floors is so hard on my back. This vacuum/wash is so lightweight and easy to move around. It does a good job on getting most stains off the floor. You might just need to go over some of the bigger ones a few times. Cons: the battery. It might last you 20 minutes on a full battery, which is fine if your place is small. My living room alone takes me at least five minutes to clean with this thing. Also, it’s not so great for small areas or close to furniture so you might just have to slightly move it to get to it. That’s really the only negative thing I would have to say about this machine. Other than that, it’s totally worth the money!! I really don’t pick up my broom, mop or vacuum anymore.

  Loved it at first.  used it in my kitchen, hallway area which is tile. Cleans well enough, but not as scrubbing but ok.  My two small dogs are in the kitchen area when i'm out so it was good in case of ""accidents"".  But great for just keeping the floor fresh.  After less then a month my machine is releasing water as I vacuum and the bottom container isn't filling up.  Have cleaned it, took it apart, top to bottom and I just can't get it to work.

  Great vacuum. Coincidentally we bought a puppy shortly after so it makes his little mistakes all the easier to clean up! It's super stinky though. Wash everything and switch out the filter and it still stinks. We've started putting a touch of white vinegar in the CWT to help and that seems to be working. I just reeeeeeeally hope it doesn't have any negative results on the vacuum. It shouldn't. So I hope not.

Also the container areas for the sucking up dirty water and clean water containers could be bigger, I typically have to dump the dirty water and refill the water/cleaning solution 3 times just to do my downstairs area.  Long battery life, works well, no streaking, picks up all the pet hair.  I wails 100% recommend this product!

  I have followed your instructions to a tee!  I clean religiously after use.  I leave apart to dry properly after use.  Then when I go to use it next  time it will run for about 3 seconds and tells me to clean dirty water tank or debris channel.  I've just started cleaning so obviously the dwt is empty and debris channel is clean.  I keep shutting off and returning hundreds of times.  No luck!This problem started within 2 months of owning this product and has just continued to get worse to now where the mop is completely unusable.And this isn't n due to over use or neglect.  The floors were not super dirty or overloaded with debris.  This is ridiculous!So this problem makes your mop/ vacuum COMPLETELY useless.  I splurged for the first time on a cleaning product, thinking I would really have a nice product.  All I have is a heaping pile of crap!!!!!I would give zero stars if I could!  Pathetic!!!

  Been using this vacuumed for couple of months now. The vacuum does a decent job overall, however considering its price I wouldn't buy it again based on several defects that don't justify the price.First of all, due to its design the brush can't reach the edges but actually leaves a space of 1-2 inches of untouched surface (doesn't suck nor clean the area). The brush also seems pretty thin - I would have used a thicker brush that helps with stronger cleaning power.Also, many drops of water/liquid are left by the vacuum on the surface (I use it mainly on hardwood floor) and these won't dry in couple of minutes unless with dry cloth or similar.The vacuum also spills water from the dirty water container during the auto cleaning while stationig on its charging base.The suction power isn't that strong as advertised. I need in fact to use my other vacuum for a complete cleaning.Noise is decent and lower than other vacuum on the market.Light weight and battery are decent.

  Updated; The manufactor and seller should offer a refund and free upgrade when the next version comes out.  Stopped working after a month due to lack of suction, and the electronic voice goes off every 5 minutes regardless of whether the tank is wet or dry.  Basically, very poor suction, not as advertised in the least bit.  Very bad product and borderline scam of a tool that is way over-priced and not at all what was promised.  I should have went with one of the Bissells.I was very critical to spend money on this, but the reason I splurged on the newer model was due to the 35-40 minute battery life.  The machine also is very small.  Do not let that betray you when you are choosing between that and the Bissell.  Quality wise I think this item is a bit higher in terms of parts, however, seeing as how I only had a Bissell vacuum that broke down, I wouldn't say I really can compare it to the Crosswave Max.  With that being said it did the job and I did have to change the clean water tank between 2-3x before I was done- but that is just how it works.  Solid, fluid, and easy to manage, I also found it worked decent on the area rugs I have after about 2 passes.  If you have a big house, I would go with a Bissell or other mop vacuum, but I am happy with this purchase, because it takes 1/3 of the time to vacuum and mop and that is why it was made.

  I would give this product 5 stars, but it runs for a few minutes and then it flashes for a self clean in the middle of the cleanup. So, I have to re-dock it and let it self cleanse, empty out the container, re-fill it and finish.However, it does a great job with quick cleanups, especially behind my toddler.Powerful suction- it glides itself, you just guide it. I used to use a steam mop and I immediately threw it to the curb after I ran my tineco over it. It picked up so much dirt on my hardwood floors, it was disgusting. My floors feel and look better, as if I just moved in.Quick dry.I did a FB live and had so many people asking about it.All in all, a great investment!

  The idea of it is wonderful but.... if you want to go close to the wall to vacuum some dirt, dust, water or anything u can think of, the vacuum wont pick it up. It can only vacuum and wash 1-1 1/2 inch away from the wall/baseboards ( u name it). U have to take a broom or a regular vacuum to clean very close to the wall because this vacuum wont do it. Another thing that i would of liked to be different: when you push the vacuum forward you will have the wheels marks on your floors. Another one: you cannot go under couch or tables with it, if you tilt it too much the brush will come up too high and wont touch the floors. For the money you pay for it you expect at least to clean all the way to the wall and not to be forced to redo the job with the broom. The dirty water tank could be bigger, it fiLs up too quickly.

  I am thrilled with how this machine cleans my bamboo floors. It’s easy to use and very easy to empty. I was hesitant to purchase because the directions say to use Tineco cleaning solution and I worried it would become costly. But it only requires a tiny cap full so the solution that comes with the machine will last me for a year I would guess. It’s very quiet and self propelled so using it is easy. I love that it’s cordless. I only have two rooms with hard flooring and I still had plenty of charge left after cleaning both floors. I don’t love cleaning but this is one of my favorite purchases. It makes doing the work so incredibly easy.

  This thing is amazing. Where have I been? How come I didn't know this kind of thing was out there?I am literally that person who crushes it at work, walking my dog, scooping kitty litter. Doing some other stuff. Generally being okay at lots of things. But, I cannot mop to save my life because I hate how much work it is, even with the velcro sticker wet pads and all that business.Listen, guys, this thing vacuums and mops at the same time, my floor looks like a polished rollerskating rink, this thing literally CLEANS ITSELF when you are done, and it has a cool beepy light buttons. I had to review it because if you have been doing a lot of research and are sitting on the fence, you found the one you were looking for. I decided to get this one and not the ifloor model just below this one because it has more suction power 30W and the other one only has 8W. I have a dog and a new puppy, so, I figured it was better to be on the safe side.Anyway, sometimes I pull it out and use it just because it's cool and my floors are already kinda clean. So. Anyway. Buy it.

  We purchased this after watching countless videos on TikTok. I was convinced we needed it. We have hard flooring throughout our entire place so I didn’t mind the fact that it wasn’t usable on rugs and carpet. The only inconvenient thing I would say is that there is no vacuum only option.It does exactly what it says it does. It doesn’t leave any streaks behind, and the floor dries within seconds after. If you can make peace with the no vacuum only option, and have no need for it on carpet, I think this machine is worth the money.I only gave it 4 stars due to the no vacuum only setting, that would have made it the best floor machine on the market.

  Like many, I've found that this makes my hard floors so much cleaner. Does it deep clean? Well, if you've got blueberries stains or dried egg yolk on your concrete basement floor, it will not clean that. However, it does help to loosen the stains and makes them a little easier to scrub by hand, and then running the Tineco over it will help to dry the floor faster. Usually, I use this on my tile floor, linoleum bathroom floors, and quickly over my hardwood in the foyer and one powder room. For at least 5 minutes each day after I've finished running the Tineco over my floors, they are clean, and I savor the moment.

  I just received this item yesterday. I was able to use it on my kitchen and two bathrooms before it started acting up. This machine is supposed to start cleaning once you power it on and tilt the handle back, but after it’s first use it would no longer do that. The display screen worked fine and there was no problems with the self cleaning mode, it just no longer worked when tilted back, even after thoroughly checking it while using the troubleshooting suggestions. I’m so disappointed, I really did love this when it was working. I have requested to return the item through Amazon as of today, and will be purchasing the Bissell Crosswave Cordless Max instead.

   I thought my other mop was good enough, until I got this. Zero streaks, and look what it’s picked up in just 3 days and one room (I have 2 big dogs that run around the grassy backyard a lot, it’s not a mud pit). I have heart  issues that make it impossible to vacuum the house and then go back and mop it, which until now meant I was always behind on the dog hair and dirt. While I wish this guy had a bigger water tank and better battery life, boy does it make up for it in what it picks up and to be able to do both vacuuming and mopping in one step instead of two, means I can actually keep up on the maintenance. It’s super easy to clean and maintain, and the video speaks for itself. Buy this!!!

I 100% recommend.I couldn’t hook up the the Bluetooth but I’m also not sure what benefit that is. I’m alittle suspicious of the blue to red ring screen on the top. It picks the oddest times to be red for dirty and then sometimes when I feel like it should be red dirty, it isn’t. But either way it works greatbattery life is good.Self clean is greatI don’t feel like I need to refill the water or empty the dirty water often. When on max power it uses more water so both tanks WILL fill up quickly but I keep mine on auto.

  This is an excellent machine for cleaning hard floors. We have had many floor scrubbers and we like this one the best. We raise dogs for a living so we use it multiple times a day. The problem is with the electrical supply. One of the units burned out the contacts. The second one we have now has stopped charging. They were very good to work with but I really want one that stays working. The cheaper model works very well as well and has had less issues. We prefer this one as it is stronger and better made but will probably go back to the cheaper model.

  Stopped suctioning after 1 use!! Called Customer service. Will update after their responseCustomer service was very good with responding and sending me a replacement. The first replacement was another model which also didn’t work properly (telling me to clean the brush roll very 5 min ) and they replaced that one with the correct model. The new replacement works great! I love the ergonomics - very easy to use for someone with a back pain. Cleans very well and easy to clean! The unit actually tells you when to empty the dirty water tank and when to refill the clean water tank. The cleaning solution is streak less and very effective. I asked for an extended warranty Because of my concerns about reliability ( the unit comes with a 2 year warranty) and customer service agreed but they keep replying that the extended warranty is 2 years. Not sure if that is a language barrier problem. Love the unit for it’s streamlined look and self cleaning features. Much easier to clean then my daughter’s Bissell Crosswave.

    Six months later...here's the scoop
  
","









  
  
    
  I love my tineco. Three kids, a big dog and a house with nothing but wood floors. Swiffer wetjet just pushes the mess around and you have to vacuum separately first. So let's talk about the downsides....-You will go through a lot of cleaning solution even just using a cap's worth per fill.  I use my tineco once every two days on average and I went through three bottles in six months. You can't get this through amazon because it's back-ordered so you have to order from their website and pay shipping.-Mine stopped working out of nowhere a few weeks ago the process to get a new one under their warranty has been HORRIBLE.  I had to send them a video with super strict size requirements showing them that their machine truly was broken.  I had to download a special app to make a video that demonstrated I had tried everything they required but would keep the video size small enough. Then they sent me a label and said ship it back and when we get it we will give you a new one.  Except they didn't send packaging materials.  $27 later I had the right size box and packaging that met their label's requirement. Customer service will not take your call you have to communicate strictly via email.  It took me a whole month to get the replacement and lots of emails from their ""customer care"" in broken English.-It stinks! If you don't clean out the catch bin really good every time and constantly change the filter it gets an odor to it.I love the machine, it's great for muddy, sticky messes but customer care needs an overhaul.

  Tineco FloorOne S3. This thing kicks major ass, IMO. I have a very large floor plan with a mix of engineered hardwoods and ceramic tiles (I believe. Maybe porcelain). I have 3 small kids and lose my mind on a daily basis trying to sweep up debris and clean spills/splatters multiple times every day. Especially around mealtime.I had been considering a Bissell, but heard a couple things that made me hesitant.  Well, I heard about this, and saw a couple comparison videos. Then it went on sale. Instead of my usual analysis paralysis, I pulled the trigger and am so glad I did!  Between all the hair my 3 girls and I shed, and all the hair and fur their dolls and ponies shed I wasn’t sure this would get the job done. But it does!  It’s lightweight. Has good forward pull. Puts down just enough fluid, but not too much. And picks up every damn crumb.I have used it every day for almost a month now. Having my sweeping and mopping done in one step is almost freaking giddily orgasmic. Now I don’t fear serving rice for dinner or giving my kids chips. Nor do I have to threaten them with the iron maiden if they make a mess. In fact, it’s so easy to use that my 5yr old can manage it too. I can get about 1800sqft of space done and still be at around 30% power left. Depending on how dirty the floors are I can get everything done without having to refill or empty the tanks. The cleaning solution that comes with it smells so dang good, but not overbearingly so (I get migraines from strong scents). And my floors FEEL cleaner afterwards. My husband even noticed they feel different and he generally never notices anything having to do with cleaning.Also, mine S3 appears to charge very quickly. I use it several times a day and never have had an issue.Please note, as awesome as this is, you may still need to sweep/wipe out tight corners. My half bath has a space between the toilet and the wall that is too narrow for this to fit. It does have suction that helps with lint/hair/fur at the baseboard edges, but for heavier stuff you may still need to sweep it out a bit. It’s never been a big issue for me though.  I am SUPER anal about my floors and this machine leaves me super satisfied.Also note, this will NOT scrub grout. Nothing will. Not even this. It will clean it, but not scrub it.

   Coming from a momma of two and a clean house lover, I had to try this vacuum mop! I absolutely love the functionality of the product and the convenience. Truthfully, I haven’t picked the broom up, but maybe a handful of times since my purchase. It has made my everyday cleaning process so much more simple. This product is absolutely worth every penny. While we are all hoping for a miracle robot to follow us around and clean our messes at immaculate standards, let’s be real they don’t exist right now. This product is not going to deep clean, rejuvenate or steam clean your floors. However, the product does clean recent stains, dirt, hair and small object debris. I find it best to deep clean my floor once a week using my heavy duty steam mop, and my tineco for everyday use. Definitely would buy over and over again! I do wish the product had a light near the suction roller, larger tank capacities and the cleaning solution was much more accessible. But all in all, I love my tineco!

    Disappointed
  
","









  
  
    
  Unfortunately this was an expensive disappointment for me. Such a good idea but falls short in many ways.  Leaves streaks on my floor no matter how I use it. Get the “dirty water tank full” warning when the tank is no where near full. Can’t finish half my regular living space without doing a self clean. Doesn’t get close to the edges where all the dirt really collects. We’re hard on our floors, no doubt- with 2 dogs and lots of red clay, but for $300 I should be able to clean the entire desired area in 1 pass without streaks and without stopping to self-clean.Also, don’t expect to be able to use on rugs or carpet. There’s no where near enough suction for that.Finally, can’t find replacement brush rollers or solution in stock, ever.Will likely be returning and going back to my shark vacuum with regular mop.

  Well… this has been a rollercoaster ride since receiving this floor cleaner. I was in love the first two months until the day it stopped sucking and started er.. to suck.. in the sense of “ well this sucks”The vacuum motor would not come on and it would leave the floor wet. Tried all the suggested albeit limited troubleshooting tips to correct this to no avail. Finally after sending the information via email to the factory, I received a response to take video, document it through their warranty portal. Repeat this process a couple of times and then was informed that they would be sending me a new machine but not until I packaged and sent them the malfunctioned unit. Of course they would pay shipping, but I had thrown the box out and was in the process of selling my house that had wood floors throughout the entire upper story that would need to be cleaned before closing. Needless to say , I persuaded them to send me the new and I’d send the old back when I had the box. All of the correspondence was a little tough due to the country of origin and the differing written dialect but worked out in the end. Got a new machine a week after the deal was finalized. Fast forward to now. 7 months after the second machine was received, it has also died. The fact that sucks the most is- it’s unexpected and when your floors are dirty, you grab it off the charger and turn it on then disappoint immediately sets in. It was working the last time you used it then nothing. I’m pretty disappointed with this cleaner. For $300 bucks, 2 machine failures and having to go back to the old fashioned cleaning method, I’d do it over without having discovered  this revolutionary cleaning machine and stick with the basics but unfortunately I’ve been spoiled for the last 9 months and may not be able to turn back. If you want to take the chance that you’ll receive a machine that will last forever, go for it. If not, I’d spend my money on Something else.

  I was really excited about this and I thought I worked well and was easy to use BUT after about 4 uses the motor malfunctioned and the vacuum is not fixable. It was not used roughly or with extra dirty floors or anything. I called Tineco’s customer service and they advised me to return to Amazon. They said they would offer a discount after I bought another, but I will not be doing that. I was really hoping they would replace it but they didn’t. For $300 I am extremely disappointed. If you buy this, save the box! Returning it was such a pain!UPDATE: The company emailed me back and said they were going to ""replace the whole unit"" but it would be at the end of the month. I was waiting and waiting and never received it. When I checked back with them they acted like this was never a thing and that I was not going to get one since I received a refund. THEY were the ones to offer to send me a new one, without any prompting from me. This whole experience has just been terrible and I wish I would have listened to the reviews that said not to buy this.

  So long swifter and dirty floors! Use to clean the tile floors daily with 2-3 wet swiffer over 20 minutes and exhausted as pushing down required to clean. With iFloor - floors are clean takes 5 minutes without a drop of sweat. And it has self cleaning mode. The only thing I wish is bigger tank for both clean and dirty water. But overall 300% improvement from using swifter or wet mop.

  The idea of this is spot on. If it worked like the reviews I’ve seen I’d be in love with it. The price is far too high for a machine that has short battery life. It also doesn’t get edges and corners at all. It leaves about an inch of untouched space on edges. The suction power is amazing and it can take on some heavy duty messes but it will not do edges. I also feel like for the price I shouldn’t have to be changing water as often. I wanted to love this vac so much. I do love it. It just doesn’t do what I was expecting it to do. Maybe I have too high expectations based off of all the rave reviews on every social media platform. I am still deciding if I want to return it or keep it. 😔

  This product does an ok job at hard surfaces but does not reach in corners or around objects. This product leaves an untouched surface of around an inch or so. This is pretty annoying since dirt and grime gets into corners most often. For the price , this should work wonders but it doesn't.  I originally bought this for my dad,  he has vinyl floors and it works ok. I used it on my stained concrete floors and it didn't seem to perform as well. I think I'll stick to my shark steam floor cleaner. The battery does stay charged for 25 mins or so . That is pretty good for having to charge 4-5 hours. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone that wants their entire floor clean.

  When it works it does it's job well. Unfortunately the machine rarely finishes a single room before needing to go through a cleaning cycle. When the cleaning cycle is done and fluids are emptied/refilled the machine frequently errs out saying it needs another cleaning cycle. We run another cycle, get the same error several times then give up in frustration. This is after sweeping the floors first to remove pet hair and debris. I will keep fighting it for a while but expect we will go back to our mop and bucket.

  One of the rare moments when a product doesn’t just work, it works as well as the manufacturer said it would. Our home is mostly solid hardwood floors but also has one room with LVT and 4 with tile. On one charge and a little less than two tanks of fluid this thing did all of them. More importantly, the floors are clean. We re-vacuumed the main living area with an empty catch bin to check, snd no hair remaining from our two shedding dogs. And, a wipe check with a clean white towel got nothing.The only draw back was emptying the tank. There was, as expected, a lot of dog hair. But… I took it as evidence of success.Goodbye two step, less effective, and much harder process with vacuuming then Swiffer wet.

  this product is exactly what I was looking for. I swiffer and mop my floors and it would seem like they were never fully clean. Since using this product my floors feel so clean and so much better. The clean and dirty water chambers are a breeze to change. It's so easy to push too. It feels self propelled. The dirt & hair I got the first use was unreal. This thing is great with dog hair! I highly recommend this!

  I have 2 dogs who shed so bad so I still vacuum or sweep before because this vacuum doesn’t handle the amount of dog hair in my house the best BUT overall I still think this vacuum is amazing and as long as you keep it clean and take care of it you’re good to go. Most of my house of hardwood and I haven’t seen the floors looking this good in a long time.

  I seriously had some doubts buying this I have 2 dogs a cat and children (plus babysitting kids) and this made my floors look brand new I have only had it for one day but man I don't want to stop using it! The one complaint I guess I could have is the battery life but I mean if I do the full house I don't expect it to last long! I did half my house on full battery and it died just at my last little corner. I have around a 1200sqt house.

  Can’t rave enough about this machine. I was very skeptical about the machine and brand which I’ve never heard of. Machine cleans floors leaving NO streaks! Went back with a wet paper towel and a dry one and there was absolutely nothing. The only thing is that it doesn’t get the corners but I get that when I’m cleaning my baseboards. Maneuvers very easily and picks up dog hair and misc trash even cleans the door mats. Very satisfied with my purchase. 30 day review used 2X week tile and wood floor.

    Vacuuming and mopping at once saves so much time!
  
","









  
  
    
  I've always done floor cleaning the old-fashioned way--vacuuming everything up, then returning with a mop/bucket (or more recently with a Bona spray mop).I wasn't prepared for how well the Floor One S3 works! Put hot water with a bit of cleaner in the clean water section, turn it on, and start to go over the (urethane) hardwood floors. It's reasonably quiet as it scrubs the floor with the roller. The majority of the water is removed by the vacuum and it quickly tries (within a minute or two).The water that came out after the first time was filthy--and this was 2-3 days after the floor had been mopped conventionally. Incredible. The tanks and roller are easy to clean, and this thing is so convenient that I mop the kitchen a couple times a week (and I don't have dogs anymore--otherwise I'd probably use it more often). If you have something dried on and gummy, you're going to have to bend over and get it off with a fingernail--but otherwise, it's really seems to get. the floor squeaky clean.Before ordering this, I was worried that it just might be an expensive gadget but I'm convinced. No complaints whatsoever--it does a great job.

    Tineco impresses me again!
  
","









  
  
    
  First impressions: I have the original first model of the tineco in this line and I finally upgraded because I was tired of constantly cleaning the roller. This roller is a monster it will not be easily lost (the problem with my old one) the suction in this is tenfold better than my own regular vacuum. And I absolutely love the self clean cycle, this one does not hold the odor that it’s predecessor did at all.My only cons and it’s only ever so slight, is I hate the “AI” voice, I just wish she wasn’t so loud. And this has a self propeller type deal and I thought it was going to rip my arm off otherwise after getting a few cleans in I love this machine, it helps tremendously in between normal cleaning and I don’t really have a bad enough complaint to hinder a overall 5 star review

  I'm still evaluating this floor cleaner. I've had some problems with attaching the water reservoir. I wanted to use it daily but it says to allow the roller to dry out before reassembling. A second roller would be helpful. I hope it lasts long enough to make the $300 purchase worthwhile.

It stops in the middle of cleaning, doesn’t pickup dirt/debri very well, leaves water streaks water puddles really) all over my floor, when using the self cleaning button on the charger it fills the charging tray up with water then stops the cleaning process. No matter how much or how dirty the water gets if you leave it in the tank longer than about 12 hours it starts to stick really bad and mold inside the tank and filter. I tried getting ahold of the company to fix issues before my 30 days that I could return it to Amazon to no avail. I tried calling, and emailing and could never get a response. The website gives you no real trouble shooting options just makes you go in circles.Customer service is a joke!

    A must have for dog owners
  
","









  
  
    
  I purchased this back in March and have been trying it for awhile before reviewing. I was on a search to find a good vacuum/mop combo item and after trying two other highly recommended brands (And being left disappointed) I stumbled upon this one. I have two dogs that create a lot of hair/messes and cleaning the floors was a dreaded task since it would take hours to vacuum everywhere and then to go back and mop. This had changed that! The price of this machines is high but no more mopping for me! It makes it easy to clean my floors and picks up the dog hairs which I appreciate. I also have laminate, tile, and carpet in my house and it performs pretty well on all of them. It misses some stuff in the deeper grout lines on tiles and doesn’t always get very last piece of lint off the higher pile carpet but overall performs well for maintenance cleanings. If you have a house with full laminate then this is a MUST!

    Great Floor Cleaner
  
","









  
  
    
  I'm very happy with this purchase. My floors are actually clean now. I didn't realize that when I was using a regular swiffer mop that I was mostly just pushing dirt around. Then I saw someone post a video of their Tineco on tiktok and I knew I had to have one. Its very easy to use and does a great job. I clean my kitchen floor, entry hall, main hall, and an 8x8 section of flooring by my back door, all on full max power and the battery never gets below 30%. My constructive criticisms are as follows:1) The dirty water tank and the clean water tank do not coincide as far as timing. For instance, my dirty water tank will need to be emptied and then about a minute or two later, my clean tank needs a refill. I've learned that when one needs my attention, it's best to just do both. I'd love for them to somehow make these match up.2) It would be great if they could somehow increase the capacity of both tanks.3) There is a small edge issue, meaning if you are trying to suck up a piece of dirt that is right at the part where the floor meets the wall, the size of the vacuum head does not allow you to get close enough to suck it up. This is where extra suction would make a huge difference.All in all, this is a great product and I feel so much better knowing that my floors are truly CLEAN!

  I love this product regardless of my expectations. I was so excited to have a vacuum/mop combo (my first ever!), but my expectations weren't reality. I somehow thought this would be a one and done product for my kitchen and bathroom floors. It would be if I wasn't a dog fanatic with dogs that shed, so be warned to managed your expectations. This will pick up all dirt and dust while mopping and does great for mopping, but it will not pick up all your pet hair without clogging. I will still have to sweep before using, but this was still a fantastic purchase!!

I do not like that it does no reach all the way to the edge. It leaves about a 1"" gap around the edges of everything.4. Yes it all has to dry but it is easy to clean!Overall it's been great for simple cleaning. I can't say that it is the best at deep cleaning and getting stuck on food off the floor but for the mop/vacuum combo it's a time saver!

  I purchased this because I hate to sweep, vacuum, then mop.  Usually, I didn't get it all done.  I have two large dogs that shed and also carry in dirt from outside daily.  They use a doggie door and dust follows them.This vacuum has made it so much easier to have truly clean floors!I will say cleaning the tank is disgusting as it captures so much that it is like pouring out mud instead of water.  That is also a positive as you can visualize the amount of dirt on a floor.  Also, you may have to clean the tank a couple times during your vacuuming use.  I know mine gets clogged with lots of fine dog hair.I only have hardwood and the self propelled part of this vacuum makes it a breeze.  It glides easily while providing a strong suction.I would definitely purchase again.

You can watch the video and see why. The video is what came up from my kitchen, living room rug, and hallway carpet. It doesn’t say to use it on carpet but we did and it worked great. We have a potty training 2 year old so accidents + carpet = not good results. My floors literally FEEL different to walk on. My son is scared of the vacuum sound and he is unbothered by this because it’s so much quieter. 10/10 recommend.

  Very inconvenient. One minute it will say you have to remove the dirty water. Once you do that it will tell you it needs self cleaning, but the self cleaning never finishes because either the dirty water is too ""full""  or the clean water is empty. I can never get anythinh done with this thing that requires maintenance every 2 minutes or so. Do not recommend

No hassle. My only regret is not buying it sooner. I just ordered the cordless stick vacuum for this brand because I love how simple it is to use and so efficient. It really does make cleaning so quick! I would highly recommend this product. Especially if you have messy kids! ;)

  Likes- the floors look amazing after I clean it, the suction is pretty good, I have a dog and a cat and it gets the dog hair well.Dislike- it does need to self clean a lot, depending on how often you clean your floors, if you go a couple days without cleaning it’s going to need to self clean multiple times. It takes awhile to charge, but the battery does last long enough to clean my whole house.

  I love this machine! I was surprised to learn that it has self-drive which makes mopping so much easier. Got this because our home has all tile floors. Our regular mop and cleaners were leaving a residue and the floor never really looked clean and my shoes would make a sticky noise walking through the house. Put the Tineco to the test as soon as I got it. Floors look clean and you can no longer see any residue. And my shoes don’t make the sticky noise anymore! I love that it tells you what it is doing or what it needs you to do. And the spill/mess detector does work. You can see the ring turn to red, it kicks in to high mode, and you can watch it go to blue as you focus on that area. Would like bigger tanks for clean and dirty water so I can do the whole house without having to refill or dump, but those steps are really easy. And the self cleaning works really well on the roller.

  I heard about vacuum/floor washers from an ad from Bissell.  I was looking into purchasing it, but the customer reviews did not sound promising.  The machine was not inexpensive.  So I gave up, until I saw something about this Tineco machine.  Every rating was 4 star and the reviews were promising.  I really love it.  It is easy to maneuver and simple to operate.  Customer service is excellent; although I have not had to use it, they reached out several times after my purchase to see if I needed any support.  The machine is also more affordable than the Bissell.  I recommended it to my son-in-law, and he really loves it!  He uses it almost every day and has nothing but positive things to say about it.  I absolutely recommend it.

  BUY IT NOW. I’ve been waiting since before Christmas for it to be in stock again. It just came in yesterday. I charged it and got to work and it is life changing. It’s so quick, easy and fairly quiet so I don’t wake my light sleeping kids upstairs. The main downfall is the small water tanks for the clean and dirty water as well as the battery life. But as long as you use and clean your floors regularly, there’s no reason you can’t clean 1,000sqft house in the amount of time of the battery life. It’s so convenient compared to sweeping and then mopping and does a much better, as well as quicker, job. It’s worth every single penny and cleans amazingly.

  This product exceeded my expectations! My floors have always felt and looked dirty, streaked up,and hazy with other floor cleaners. But after using the Tineco One S3, they look as clean as the day they were brand new! It takes a few, initial cleanings to get there. But each time you use it, you can immediately see that the dirty water tank gets cleaner and cleaner, after each use. When our wooden floors were finally to the point of CLEAN, keeping them in a clean state has been EASY and effective.  I highly recommend this unit for cleaning wooden floors.

  I waited awhile after I used this a couple times to write my review. This by far is the best cleaner I have had! My floors are all ceramic tile and I’ve went through about every cleaner there is including the crosswave. Very little assembly and very easy to operate! The only complaint I have about this product is the water tank is kind of small so you have to stop to refill often but worth every penny! If your thinking about a purchase let me make your mind up because I am a picky person with OCD and this passed all my tests!

  I was so nervous when trying to choose which mop/vac to get. I read tons of reviews and articles and took the plunge and ordered this one. I was not disappointed at all! I seriously love this thing. It cleans well, it's convenient, I am able to do most of my house on one battery charge, I love that it is cordless and self cleaning. I would buy this thing again with no hesitation. Since purchasing mine, my mom and sister have both also bought one and rave all the time about how much they love it.

  If you have tile that has a little space between the tile and the grout, the unevenness makes the machine not clean as well. If it's a straight surface, you are fine. But if it has to ""skip"" over to another tile just a little bit, the water will skip over too and the roller. So that's a little aggravating.

    Machine Broke in less than 6 months
  
","









  
  
    
  I was thrilled when I first reviewed my Tineco iFloor 3. However, it stopped working after about 4.5 months. When I reached out to customer service, they were responsive, but it slightly annoying having to convince them over 3-4 emails that the machine was definitely broken, not just user error. You can’t call them, only email - so these exchanges took a week or two. Once I made it clear it was broken, they very quick to send me a return label to send back my machine and said I would get a replacement in return. It has been a month since my return machine was received by Tineco. I reached out to find the status of my replacement machine and I got the response that they see a request for return has been sent, but they had no shipping status. That was two weeks ago. I’ve since sent three more emails asking for a status and they have simply stopped replying. Since you can’t call them, I have no choice but to keep emailing and hope for a response, otherwise this has been a waste of money. A machine at this cost should not break with normal use after just a few short months.

  I got this to map up areas in times when I didn’t want to get the whole mop and bucket out.  I figured for spot cleaning and touch ups it would be great. I haven’t had to get the mop bucket out since buying this.  It does a great job, doesn’t use a lot of water, and cleans it’s self after use.  The buttons can be a little finicky at times, being a touch screen. But really that’s a minor complaint compared to the benefits of this.

  This wonderful machine has come into my life and I love it. It’s self propelled, uses a perfect amount of water to clean but not soak my wood floor , and the computer lady talks to me with directions to empty dirty water or fill more cleaning water. Then the machine actually cleans itself on it’s charging station. This has cut my work time by 75%. I am so grateful to have found a way to help me clean because at 75 years old it’s getting harder every day. This is a game changer.

  I do like it and think I will keep it but it’s not as life changing as all the reviews claim. I would say it’s good for light cleaning daily but not for stuck on tough dirt or spills. If something is left there to harden it’s not coming off easily with this guy and it takes many many passes to make the floors clean. I used it on smooth tile for reference. It is good at vacuuming but didnt grab big chunks (like dog food kibble). So i think I will still steam mop to get the deep clean and then maintain with this guy during the week

  It did a great job cleaning my hardwood. The unit appears to be designed pretty well for both effective cleaning and easy maintenance. The tanks are small, but unless your floors are coated in something sticky, it will clean the floors fine with a few quick passes and it's very water efficient so they last a while. It even sucked up the dog hair no problem (I have a husky) and it gets caught on a trap in the dirty tank. The little charging base/self cleaning tray is great, too.The only real negative I have is that I would have like a corded option that was a little bit cheaper.

I was amazed because usually when I mop the floors then dry up with the towel its dirty...not anymore. I use this on tile and hardwood with no trouble. I def recommend you empty it out and self clean it and dry out the roller after each use to keep the roller nice and fresh...def don't want it souring. Highly recommend this product!

  I really enjoyed using the easy to use mop! It was light weight and mobile due to being cordless. However, there were a few things that made this product not worth it for me. 1. Didn’t erase dog slobber stains on the hardwood floors (my dog isn’t a heavy slobberer) 2. The clean water tank is pretty small and needs to be refilled quite frequently, even after just 5 minutes of usage 3. The dirty water tank is larger but requires dumping once the tank is filled about 1/4 of the way. 4. To get the battery back to a full charge even after 5-10 minutes of use takes 45 min to an hourOverall, I tested for one day and found it wasn’t worth it for my family.

I’ve used it maybe 3 times. I like that I don’t really have to dry the floor. It leaves very little moisture behind. The cleaning solution is potent and smells fresh. I have a hard time getting the roller brush dry after cleaning. We’ll see... if it can become part of my daily routine with 2 kids, husband, and a dog. It does pick up the dog hair wonderfully!

  I have some nasty faux wood laminate flooring that’s 12 years old. It shows up all the smudges and dirt. We’ve mopped, we’ve used a robot mop, we have got on our hands and knees and scrubbed. Still, if you rubbed a moist paper towel on the floor, DIRTY. Not anymore. I’ve cleaned all the floors in my house in the past two days since it arrived, and these bad boys are finally clean. We are very tidy people, two adults, one cat. We are constantly dusting and cleaning up in the house (we are those people), so when we are barefoot all day and we look at our feet, we were disgusted with he muck on our feet. No matter how often or what we used, mucky floors. You would think we didn’t clean at all!!!! This machine makes it easy. It self propels, it lets you know where the dirt is and when it’s clean again, it self cleans and OMG, the first time you empty that dirty water compartment….well, don’t do it on a full stomach. Wish the battery was longer, but heck, you can’t have it all. It is a pain to empty the compartments and fill up the reservoir, but then again, you are getting a fantastic scrubbing floor cleaner and every time you use it, it is clean and ready. After cleaning the kitchen floor (we are major cooks, so it’s the dirtiest floor), we did the moist paper towel rub test and it was CLEAN! I’d never get someone in to clean my house, so the money I won’t spend on that is a fraction of the cost of this machine.

  First off, the OCD in me was coming out when I saw it doesn’t stand straight when docked. I thought mine was defective when I saw it leaning that far forward. Just don’t understand the reasoning for it.Battery life is awful, and I’m constantly either refilling the water or emptying the bin even on regular settings opposed to max settings.Be sure to have your manual handy bc all the icons that start flashing are so confusing and hard to distinguish what each one could mean without looking it up. The icons they chose just doesn’t make it easy to know what it’s trying to tell you in my opinion.Self cleaning option was great in theory. But you can’t use it if the battery is low even when docked and you need to fill the water bin. Doesn’t really do much bc everything still needs to be taken apart, rinsed and set out to dry for 24 hours before you can use it again after every single use or you’ll be smelling it 100% after just one use.With all that being said, it does perform well as a vacuum and mop overall. But- Corners are hard to get and can’t go too low underneath furniture before it starts to lift up off the ground.

  This product can be absolute junk when it wants to be but can also be great too.

Probably for this same problem I am having. I have company coming and my floor mop is spewing water all over my floor and won’t suck anything up. I’ll stick it back on to charge and when it reaches 100% charge it will just magically fix itself and decide to work again. Going back to my good old handy dandy mr. clean spin mop from the dollar general which was 20$ That’s better than spending 400$ + warranty on this thing. Just one HONEST review.

  First of all, the product is fantastic. It really cuts down our cleaning time. As an example, my one year old nephew enjoyed his birthday smash cake in our kitchen. Normally the resulting mess would have been a multi-step process, but with the Tineco we were able to clean the floor fast and easy!Second, Tineco’s customer service is equally awesome. I was very sad to see the price drop significantly on this product a week after we had purchased it. As per Amazon’s policy, they would not adjust the price. I contacted Tineco directly and they gave me a credit to their online store. I was able to stock up on the cleaning solution so I wasn’t out the price difference. I was very impressed with their service!

The floor drys pretty fast afterwards as well. 4 stars because I wish the tanks were larger but I can live with it for how good my floors look 🤷🏻‍♀️….. almost a year later and I’m thinking about going back to a normal mop! No matter how much I clean this by hand (not just self clean) it smells dirty and musty when ran some times. I still like using it for spills and dog mess but I’m considering following it up with a mop afterwards because of the smell it puts off!

This is a game changer for me as it vacuums AND mops (two birds one stone) and it self cleans. All I have to do when I’m done it hit the button, dump and rinse the attachments and set them out to dry. Mine is drying now in my photo. It picks up and mops everything well. I imagine when winter comes I’ll be using it even more as now when people trample in snow, salt and mud I’ll just use this to get it up instead of always having to have towels and wash them too!

  Spending $400 on anything is way out of my price bracket but I was looking for something that would help make it easier clean the floors with my toddler, 2 teenagers and 2 dogs. I loved this machine but after about 4 months the suction would barely pick up the dirty water and in self cleaning mode the water would shoot out over the charging base until finally 2 months later the voice prompt told me to reset the unit and contact customer service. Tineco has a excellent warranty & customer service! I lefr a voice mail and the called me back the next day to troubleshoot and concluded it migbt be a motor problem so it would need to be sent back for repairs and emailed a prepaid shipping label. It took about 2 weeks and they sent me a new machine because the old one couldn't be repaired. They kept in contact with me the whole time letting me know the status of my machine and was always very polite. I'd recommend Tineco to anyone who asked my opinion.

    Worst buy I've ever made!
  
","









  
  
    
  I got this product today, i will be returning tomorrow! I normally don't leave bad reviews but if i could go back and not buy this I would. Im going to make this short and sweet as best I can with all the issues I ran into.The vacuum itself is so cheaply made, its not sturdy and just slides around the floor unless going in a direct up and down movement.It LEAKS.... the dirty water tank wasn't close to full and it was spraying dirty water all over the base and my floors. Also leaks from the sides of the dirty water tank and drips behind leaving you to clean it up anyways. Don't try using this under chairs either or places to get under bc it will LEAK!My downstairs is pretty open but small and I had to refill the tank 4 times just to finish the floors. Also emptying the dirty water several times.When using it, i wasnt 5 minutes in when the self clean light started to flash. Not sure if you just ignore that or have to stop and self clean it every time. But as a mom with 2 young kids I cannot just keep stopping to self clean this awful vacuum!I have a dog that does shed so thats another issue with it. All the dog hair just flys around the floor from the air coming out the front so your constantly chasing it. Also the dog hair you do collect stays on the front of the vacuum like static and you have to take that apart off later to clean it.One picky thing of mine was it doesn't have a light on it so you have to have or turn all your lights on or vacuum in the daytime.The self cleaning system is a JOKE! You have to take everything apart and wipe it all down anyways. So you have to take the brush roll top part off then the brush roll to clean behind it. You have to take the filter apart and let it dry for it to be clean which is pretty normal but i would think the brush roll would be cleaner.Needless to say I was very very disappointed with this product and will be telling everyone I know not to waste their money!

  Just received my Tineco iFloor3 and I am 100% satisfied with the purchase. I swept and mopped my tile floor before using the Tineco. I went back over it all with the Tineco iFloor3 and it had picked up so much that the dirty water tank was black. I thought I was cleaning my floors before but this proved to me that I wasn’t really cleaning them at all. I am disgusted with how dirty my floors really were. If you are on the fence about purchasing this vacuum/mop, I am here to tell you to pull the trigger and do it. I will never go back to regular sweeping and mopping again.

Removed.the DWT to inspect only to see it look used with wet oily spots in the inner tank pieces.  Removed the tank top to only find hair and some remaining grime.  Looked.over the rest of the machine to find the wheels slightly used and the base had scuff marks on it.  This is definitely a used Vaccum and want my money back...

But this machine proved to be a miracle. Not only does it vacumn all the dust and hair, it mops and dry!!! It is not a complete dry, but when I walked over the freshly mopped floor, I didn't leave any tracks on it, so that's good enough for me!This machine is magical!

    Absolutel Trash - Do Not Buy

  I fear many of the top reviews are from people who had been using this the first few months.  After that it is straight downhill.  Save your money.Once this unit stopped working I contacted customer service.  After sending pictures and videos the unit was sent off, the first time it was due to a faulty battery.Once I got the unit back it ‘worked’ but did not charge.  I contacted them again, the same process ensued.  I got the unit back, still did not charge.  Same process again, sent back, unit was sent back to me without notification and yet again still did not work.  Once again the unit was sent back and I was under the impression it would be replaced,  but it was not.  The same unit was sent back, I tried multiple outlets where anything else works without issue.We basically have a $400 piece of trash that just sits around the house.  We have yet another call open with Tineco about this, it is an absolute joke.  DO NOT BUY.

    Total let down after received broken machine and Tineco dropped the ball on fixing the issue...
  
","









  
  
    
  I was so ready to love this machine after I excitedly snagged it on Black Friday sale as my own Christmas gift (and only had to wait about a week for it to ship!) I was quickly let down when I unboxed the new beauty, read and followed all of the directions, knowing to fully charge before first use to realize that it wouldn’t actually charge. I called Tineco customer service immediately, their decision was to ship me a new charging station, I agreed, thinking it would be worth the wait, because surely it wouldn’t take but a few days to get it... well I have now been waiting a month for my replacement charging station and it still hasn’t arrived. I have reached out to their customer service several times, they told me the delays were due to covid, and finally received an email on Christmas Day (ironic huh?) that the charging station finally shipped. Tracking noted that it was to be delivered after the new year, further annoyed, thinking that over a week and half to ship nearly a month after my initial claim/report was filed was excessive, but again, I accepted the defeat. Well I had checked tracking Saturday, excitement returned when I realized it was due to arrive here today, but alas, after no delivered notifications arrived, I checked tracking to see that the freaking shipment is no longer affiliated with my freaking charging station. Called Tineco, they were already closed, naturally. I give up, I’m returning something that may or may not have been the best thing to ever happen to me because I am honestly just so entirely sick of looking at a $300 paperweight. After all of the frustration, my husband came home from work today with an o cedar spin mop for me instead. It already didn’t let me down and was just as amazing as all of the reviews and go clean co said it would be. Also wanted to say that I cannot honestly tell you of the suction power, overall capabilities, or battery life of this machine based on the 15 minutes I finally used it til it died out of pure defiance on Christmas... it honestly didn’t wow me, but that may or may not have been due to my biased annoyance.

    Dogs that shed?
  
","









  
  
    
  I really wanted to like this wet/dry vacuum. I have 2 dogs who shed and a 10 month old! I think it definitely cleaned the floor, however there were a few things I was too unsure about in order to keep it for the cost I spent.-battery lasted max 20-25 minutes on lowest setting 15ish min on highest setting. Def. Not enough time to do a big room or two rooms on one battery.-after a few passes in the kitchen, it wanted to me put it back on the charger in order to self clean. This happened almost every time. Granted, there was fur on the floor, but not enough for me to understand why it needed cleaned after 5-10 swipes.-it wasn’t great with dog hairIf you don’t have a dog that sheds, this might work well for you. Unfortunately, this didn’t work well enough for me for the cost.

    Good at first but loses suction
  
","









  
  
    
  The suction power was great the first two weeks, now it leaves behind some the of the mess that needs to be vacuumed. I feel like its being moved around rather than being cleaned up. The cleaning solution tank is small so after every use you need to add new solution. The dirty water tank is also small so you need to empty out the container after using it, turn on slef clean mode and then empty out again. Not really worth the money. If I had the box still I would of returned it. Not worth 320 spent.

It only took a few minutes to assemble and I was pleased to see it came with extra parts.When I ran it, I liked how it adjusted the suction based on dirtiness. I have pets, so I decided to try to trick it. It amped up it's water output and suction near their food and water bowls, which I expected if it was working correctly. The amount of dirt in the dirty water tank made me determined to clean more often as it was pretty disgusting. It worked well on both my wood and tile floors.I'd definitely recommend this for people who have hard floor surfaces.

    TikTok made me buy it, and I’m SO glad it did.

  I’ve never written a review on Amazon before but felt compelled to after playing with my new Tineco all day.What I love about it:-I no longer have to vacuum AND swiffer my floors-This gets your floors really, really clean. Like, I thought I had clean floors before, but no. I didn’t.-lightweight-cordless-it talks to you!-easy to maneuver (it feels self-propelled, like if I let it go it would just move on its own)-dispenses the perfect amount of liquid at all times-it self-cleans the brush head-easy to fill the clean water tank, and easy to dispense the dirty water tank-slim vacuum head, so it fits under my cabinets & furniture easily-good suction-quiet (for a vacuum)-has a rubber protection around the vacuum head so it won’t scrape baseboards while you try and get as close as humanely possible so that it *might* just pick up edge grime (see below)What I don’t love about it:-long charging time-the dirty water tank is HUGE for how little it holds before it wants you to empty it-does NOT do edges at all. About a 1-2” gap.I couldn’t decide between this and the bissell crosswave, but after watching 1048292 tiktoks, I went with this because it seemed a little slimmer, seemed to have better suction, didn’t leave puddles of water when turned off, and had a smaller head so it fits under cabinets and furniture easier. Everything I saw has proven to be true so I feel like I made the right decision. It’s also not streaky at all, which was a common complaint I saw with the crosswave.When I say “my floors have never been cleaner”, I mean it. Not only are they SPARKLING, but they FEEL clean. I’ve been paying for a maid service for years and while I always thought my floors were impeccable each week after they worked their magic, they have never looked or felt this good. They didn’t even look or feel this good when they were first installed 4 years ago. It’s unexplainable.This is so easy to use and I’m obsessed with the app that you can download. Idk why, I just think it’s so fun to see how much longer until it’s fully charged, how much I’ve used it, and to have it “self-clean” with a push of a button on my phone.If you’re wanting to get this, just do it. It’s great. Yes, I listed 3 cons, but I’m still giving it 5 stars because the pros outweigh everything else here.

  At first I loved this thing. But I slowly started to hate it. It doesn’t reach the wall, but they just release a new one that does because that makes sense, but let’s talk about the company themselves. My machine malfunctioned at no fault of my own. I’ve had it for 6 months . I have a 2 year warranty and an extended 3 year warranty on it. I paid $400 for the tineco and $50 for the warranty. So why is it that when I call to replace it, they only Offer to send me back a refurbished one. And people have complained that they send refurbished ones that are also broke or filthy and smell like trash. For a $400 vacuum mop i expected better.

    Cleaning machine is time consuming

  It was to good to be true. I'm a mom of 3. I did return it. I thought it would make my cleaning easier. You have to take all the pieces apart & clean them. Its very time consuming. It would just be easier to have swept & mopped. I can't take away though that it does clean very well, suction power is very good! If you have the patience to clean all the parts, than this maybe worth it for you.  I was so excited about this until I had to clean all the parts which has to be done everytime  after you use it. Also, puts to much water out for hardwood floors & left streaks.

    My floors are actually clean!
  
","









  
  
    
  I watched several YouTube videos comparing this with other machines, and I made the right choice.  The test was after using the machine for the first time, I took a white paper towel and wiped the floor and it was clean!  Prior to this my floors looked clean until I would wipe up something with a paper towel and it would be dirty.  I like how the machine tells you when it needs more detergent, or needs to have a cleaning cycle run, or needs to be emptied or charged.  I really love how it changes colors depending on how dirty the floor is that you are cleaning, so you know to stay in the same spot, or move on.  I have only had it for two days, so I can’t speak to its longevity, but so far so good.  I was able to clean about 1500 sq ft on one charge, but unbeknownst to me they were pretty dirty, so now that they are clean it should last longer since the dirtier they are the more energy the machine uses to clean them.

  Bought this during Prime Day on a recommendation from the previous home owner. So glad we did. While this might not be be great for true hardwood floors, the tile/lvt flooring love this vacuum. It lets me clean/mop out bottom floor in no time flat with no streaking and little to no down time. Love this thing and have bought the standard dry vacuum for my mom.Definitely use 2 cap fulls of the cleaner rather than 1 which is what the manufacturer suggests and stick with the Tineco cleaner.It also has connectivity to an app that allows you to monitor self-cleans and the vacuum charge. Would definitely recommend.

  If you are here you already want one! Everyone i know has one or is waiting for catch them in stock. Makes sweeping and mopping so easy. Ohio is messy in the winter and this makes it so easy to clean all that weird white mess left on the floors from the salt on shoes.  In my 30s and my floors have never been this consistently clean lol why didn't they have these when i had little babies and zero energy to mess with mopping ?I knocked it a star for deep cleaning. It doesn't get all the way against the baseboards so i will still go through every now and then and scrub around the baseboards, toilet and tub. For daily use to clean up after kids and pets i see this as a must have and am very satisfied

  I always make purchases based on the reviews and this had really good ones but I am not impressed at all. It does have an ok suction for dust and crumbs but is not good at mopping. If there’s something really stuck on the floor you will still need to scrub or mop it. The solution it comes with smells good but if you don’t clean the brush after every single use it will stink and the cup you put it in is small so it doesn’t last long at all. Overall I wouldn’t recommend this particular brand.

    6 Month Review -  The Good & Bad.
  
","









  
  
    
  This was not an easy sale. I have had my fair share of gimmicks and come to the general conclusion that there is no fix for a quality vacuum and a solid cotton-head mop and bucket. But both of those things require the effort to use them. Which then means you don't use them as much as you'd like.And because of that my wife and I both fell in love with Tineco. For spot jobs it was amazing. We have pets and pets make messes. And if you have tile and hardwood flooring, this is machine is amazing. It's almost perfect. And frankly this is where I would list the few gripes I have, but they are so minor and nitpicky, it's not worth the effort.However, I'm writing this review today because we just sent ours back to get repaired. And as much as I hate that, I'm hoping they will take care of us and in a timely manner. We use the Tineco just about every day. Not for long stretches, but certainly a few minutes. And while it's easy to get upset about it breaking, we now have an opportunity to see how they stand behind their product.So, hit the ""Useful"" button to follow along. I'll let you know how everything works out in a few weeks when we get our repaired unit back.We really miss it.

  I used my first vac 6 times before it started shutting off after 3 sec.  I notified Tineco because I was one week out of Amazon send back. I have used hoover floor jet, Koplens and Bissil wet dry vacs. No experience with Bissil crossfire.I was impressed with being able to contact customer service by phone with no wait time. They requested a video of the problem which is reasonable but for me hard as I am 84 y/o and not technically proficient. Customer service answered my 4 phone calls promptly and sent me a new vac promptly. The machine is fault free in use. I have porceline tile. In short I give 5 stars to machine and customer service.  I hope this keeps up. I will update after more use.UPDATE: I have never written an update on anything but due to the product quality and the customer service  I feel the need. No product lasts forever but it was nice to talk to humans and send your vac back and get a new one postage free. My replacement $300 Tineco 3 is working great after about a month. Wish I could put this under 1 star so peeople will read it. I mostly read only the bad reviews as god ones are often too numerous.

  After using the Tineco Floor One S3 for several months, you don't want to use anything else. Not even the vacuum. It is addictive once you get used to it. It has it's learning curve, but once you understand all its functions you will not, and let me repeat that... You will not want to use a mop ever again. If you think your floors are kept clean, wait until you use this machine.Pros: There are so many... I will be really brief.It does everything as advertisedSimple to clean and maintainNo messComes with 2 rollers and 2 filters.Great customer serviceWell thought.Although, it is a great machine, it has very few drawbacks. Remember, it is addictive?Well...Cons:The battery. Since it is lightweight the battery is the heaviest part of it, there for its autonomy.Depending on how dirty or clean are your floors and how big your house is perfect for 550 sq ft at onceIt takes at least 1.5h — 2 hours to charge before you can use it again. Big house, long wait.The auto-cleaning process consumes a lot of battery and it is heavily recommended you clean it immediately or it will start to smell.In my opinion, it'll be perfect if, the charge time was faster and/or you could exchange the battery for continuing use.

    WOW! Blows the Bissell Crosswave Away
  
","









  
  
    
  I was hesitant to order this machine as I was unfamiliar with the brand. I read a few reviews that there were some problems with it ceasing to operate. I've gone through 2 Bissell Crosswaves in under 2 years and really needed to get a machine that worked without all the issues the crosswave had.I took the plunge, but did purchase the extended warranty just in case I do have issues with it.Shipping was a bit slow so the mop and bucket were out as well as the scrub brush which I needed with the crosswave anyway. It never was good removing anything that had dried.When my Tineco arrived I was hoping for at least the performance I had with the crosswave. I took it out of the box and inserted the handle which was a breeze, removed all the packing, it was definitely packed 1000 times better than the crosswave, plugged in the charger and set the machine into it.I let it charge overnight and tried it out the next morning. Holy Wow!!!!! Was I surprised! The suction on this machine was incredible. It's got adjustable suction power which really helps getting the dog hair up, the other machine was not the best with that. It did not stop and say the machine was clogged once! The other machine did it constantly. Dried on stuff came up like a dream. Dog hair was nonexistent! What a pleasure it is not have to sweep and then use the machine and then sweep again.When I turned off the machine there was no puddle of dirty water left on the floor as was the case with the crosswave, that would need a few paper towels to sop up.The tanks are a bit smaller than on the crosswave, but it makes the machine so much lighter that it's okay with me.Cleaning the machine is also easier than the crosswave. I don't have to stick my hand in the dirty water tank to remove the hair catch, that was really kind of a disgusting thing to have to do on a machine that costs that much. Not a good design feature at all.Not once did the new machine clog, tell me to empty the dirty water tank unless it was full or have any other malfunctions lights go off.The cleaning solution that comes from the manufacturer is terrific. It did not need to be measured into a measuring cup like the old one. One small capful is all that was needed making the filling of the clean water tank easy peasy. My kitchen tile looks better than it has in years and my LVT in the rest of the house is cleaner than it's been since it was installed.I recommend this floor cleaner over the Bissell machine 100%. I do recommend getting the extended warranty just in case, but that's just my personal thought.

  This is a must have for anyone with hardwood or vinyl flooring. Our household includes both a toddler (who is just beginning to learn how to fling food on the floor) and a hyperactive dog. We have a cordless dry vacuum that we would often use, but it just wasn't enough and would still require mopping afterwards. Because of this, we were spending a ridiculous amount of time cleaning just to try to keep up with all of the various food, vomit, and other messy substances around the house.This Tineco is a gamechanger for us because we no longer have to compromise between time and cleanliness. The battery lasts long enough for us to do the major problem areas (kitchen, dining room, living room) on a single charge. Even when the floor looks ""clean"" to the naked eye, the Tineco's dirty water tank tells a different story and you will be cleaning grime you had no idea existed (especially if you have an older hardwood floor with gaps between the boards). The unit has a self cleaning feature when it's on the charger, but you will still want to remove the roller every once in a while to clean by hand and fully dry. I would easily recommend this to anyone who has more than one or two rooms in their house with hard flooring, as I know it will help them as much as it has helped us.

   This is a remarkable mopper! I have used it all over my house for the past several days, can’t tell you how impressed I am! We have a lot of different hard surfaces in my home: tile wood and cork. I have included a video of his performance on each type of floor. The first thing I noticed is how easy it is to operate. I barely looked at the instructions, just plugged in the first night and started using it the next day. The only thing I checked was how to refill the water, which is super easy as it’s the container on top and I added the recommended cap full of cleaning solution.  I couldn’t help but notice how this product essentially pulls itself. You might notice in the videos I am operating it with one hand, and sometimes one finger. I also noticed I was able to use this on dirty floors without sweeping first. It collects dust and debris along with the water, you’ll see what you collect when you dump it out and you will be grossed out and impressed at the same time. In the video, I cleaned my white tile with a pattern so easily, and as you can imagine that is such a pain to keep clean. It’s beautiful but now that I have this mop or it will be as beautiful as it should be more often.  Then, you’ll see me bounce over to the cork floors, as easy as the tile was this was much easier if you can imagine. I don’t mop these floors very often, but I couldn’t help but mop the entire basement and I would say it took less than 10 minutes (2200 square feet). It’s lightweight so its easy to carry up and down the steps, I even mopped the steps and I’m not saying it was super easy but there is no good way to mop the steps and the result was better than normal. But, I’ve used it upstairs extensively. The wood floors upstairs gets so nasty, so for me, this mop was the solution for that. I can do the entire floor in about 20 minutes (4000square feet), but I rarely do that. I’m using a small primarily in the kitchen and living space, I use it daily and it takes just a couple of minutes. In one charge I get around 30 minutes, and that is  alternating between auto and Max. The more often I use it, I am able to use the auto setting more. In one use, expect to refill the water container at least twice. There is a voice alert that will let you know when you need to do that, as well as any other part of the mop that needs attention.Overall, this mop was definitely worth the investment. I wish I could say I’m going to throw out my mop but I will still need it to get into small corners, around toilets for example, but it will definitely replace my mop for almost everything. I also used to dry mop much more frequently, this is replacing some of that, especially in high traffic areas like the kitchen. It came with lots of accessories, an extra filter, an extra roller, and hardware it looks like to mount. I haven’t found a home for it yet so I will look into that later. For now, I’m just enjoying my clean floors, clean it with minimal effort and that’s how I roll!

  I have owned a Bissell Crosswave for three years.  That’s three years and three new Crosswaves.  I don’t know why their so highly rated because you have to replace them yearly after they quit working!  Looking for a different option I found this one.  A little more expensive but worth EVERY SINGLE PENNY!!!  I LOVE this thing!!! I can just grab it off the charger and get to it.  No hassling with cords, no spending time at the end cleaning every piece because it’s self cleaning!  What a great concept and it pulls a lot of dirt out of the brush roll and internal parts.  I love that it’s self propelled because I have a bad back and knees and it runs itself with me just to guide it!  It cleans much better than my old Crosswave, leaving my wood floors streak free.  My floors would look terrible after cleaning with my Crosswave.  It only takes 1 cap of solution with the water so you save on cleaning solution.  I didn’t think I really needed it to talk to me but it’s great because it reminds me to start cleaning cycle, fill water tank, empty dirty tank, etc.This machine is stellar in every way.  The only con is it has an internal battery so once the two year battery warranty has expired and the battery gives out I guess you have to replace it.  Even do its then lasted twice as long as my old Crosswave!  And maybe the battery will last 5 years- who knows?  No one has had one long enough to judge because it’s a pretty new item in their line.Don’t think twice and make your life easier!  Buy it now!  Lol I’m not getting paid to write this😊

   Wow! This floor cleaner absolutely blows my mind! It mood and vacuums and chooses on its own which to use with its own sensor. It can even tell the level of dirtiness and use the proper setting. Every time I’ve used it I am immediately start smiling and laughing because it makes it so fun! Once you turn it on you can let it propel itself forward and mop and vacuum depending on what your floor requires. Now I actually enjoy mopping. It arrived with a bottle of solution you mix with water and put in the top container for it to clean with. The bottom container has the filter and where the gray water goes that you will dump. At the end of your cycle you do need to clean everything so it will work fine next use. It even decides whether it should begin a self cleaning cycle when you put it back on the charging base. It comes with an extra filter and the cleaning brush. If you have a lot of bare floors at your house I would definitely recommend this.

  So, I have a very old dog who has been having problems these days. I was using a traditional mop multiple times a day to clean up after her. Having to prepare mop water every time there was a mess (starting before my coffee!) got to be a tiresome.I initially bought the Tineco iFLOOR Cordless Wet Dry Vacuum Cleaner and Mop, which worked OK for my needs, but then my hubby suggested I the higher end one, TINECO Floor One S3 Cordless Hardwood Floors Cleaner, I was glad I did.TINECO Floor One S3 is a little heavier than the Tineco iFLOOR, but that is OK since it is self propelled once it is powered up. I love that once you put it on the charging mat, it starts a check of the roller to see if it needs to be cleaned. Press a button and self-cleaning starts! Basically, I love this mop! It has saved me a lot of effort when I have to quickly clean up a spot.Cons: Well, there are a few.- Corners. I have found you have to be able to roll over the mess. So, I can't give up my traditional mop altogether, but this works in a pinch.- Modes: it has two - Auto and Max Clean. Wish there were three. Auto, Max Clean and Suction. Wish there was a way to suck up the puddle then mop over it.-Clean Water Tank (CWT) and Dirty Water Tank (DWT). Wish they were bigger. But not a game changer.If you are like me, you research (a lot) before spending hard earned $. Glad I did. This mop is worth every penny.

  It’s nice, but could definitely be better.  The dwt is a pain in the butt to put back on. If you have pets, hair will get clogged in the debris channel, so that will have to be cleaned every few uses or more if you have multiple pets. It doesn’t do that great on dried on messes.What it does do well on is cleaning up spills and dirt brought in by pets or kids.I’ve had it a few weeks now and I use it nearly everyday.

   THE CHARGING STATION IS HORRIBLE. I sent the product back to them so that they can fix it and yup they did “repair” it. It charged for at least 1 min then it went crazy again. So now I have this expensive product that I have only used probably about 5 times and now I can’t recharge it. The video attached to this is the “AFTER THEY FIXED IT”

  I bought this via Amazon in may 2021 and by September it was not working I followed everything in the manual , cared fir it  m, and I got to where it kept saying pls empty dirty water and it would shut off and there was nit debris or dirty water on tank , no water at all , I called Tineco over and over snd emailed them and got no reply … very poor member service and Amazon charged me $80 restocking fee to return it which was nice of them but it still sucked cause I got robbed

  I love it! I couldn't believe how much dirt was on my floor, until I used this Tineco I floor 3. It vacuumed and mopped the floor leaving no residue behind. My floors dried right away. I used the Tineco floor cleaner it came with. A little goes a long way.

  I use this everyday!! I do have a pretty big home, all tile so I can't do the whole house on one charge.  The clean and dirty water containers are small so even doing half my home I need to dump dirty and refill clean water container. I don't mind it because using this makes it so much easier to clean my floors!

    Throw out your old steam mop

  Pros: - Vacuums while I mop - Cleans FAR better than my old steam mop ever could - Far quicker and easier to use than my regular old mop and bucket, too - Self-cleaning cycle really gets the job done; just rinse out the dirty water tank afterwards and put it up to dry, and it'll be good to go for next time - Battery lasts as long as my motivation does 🤣Cons: - Dirty water tank fills up pretty quickly, so including the self-cleaning cycle afterwards, I need to empty the dirty water tank 3 or 4 times per cleaning session - Including the self-cleaning cycle afterwards, I need to fill the clean water tank twice per cleaning session - ""Twist handle to steer"" mechanism doesn't feel as natural as I've come to expect from devices with the upright-vacuum form factor. Not a deal-breaker, just a bit odd 🤷‍♂️

   So let me start by saying I do love this mop. It's cordless function makes it so easy to move around the house and the dirty water tank is always brown so I know it's sucking up dirt. However, it doesn't do a good job for paw prints which is the main reason I got it. I have 2 huskies so I always have dirty pawprints in my house. The flaw here comes from not being able to control the amount of water that comes out. When the floors are covered in prints it looks like its not spitting out any water hardly. To fix this issue I have to use my bissel spin wave to break up the tough prints and then I go back with the tineco to pick up the residual dirt. I'm still having to vacuum twice for a job that I was hoping this would conquer no problem. It takes forever to charge and I have to clean and refill the tank at least 4 to 5 times to do my whole house (if I can get through it in 30 minutes).Sexond: you have to use the tineco cleaning solution or you void your warranty. I havent even picked this thing up in months because I ran out of solution and It's always out of stock. What good does it do me to have a mop I can't use.Overall it does a good job at picking up dirt but it doesn't make my life any easier.

  The money is spent on this wasn't worth the little amount of cleaning it did. I would describe it as superficial. We have vinyl planking and also aggregate concrete. It did a horrible job on the aggregate just made a liquidy mess and didn’t reach the small texture cracks in the vinyl however the water did come out dirtyish( by no means black or filthy). Also when i ran it in on my vinyl planking i would run it for 2 minutes and then the self cleaning indicator would start flashing i would have to run over and run it on a self cleaning then would have to refill the reservoir and then run it again for two minutes. The hassle was not worth the trouble.  If you have one consistent flooring like concrete, epoxy or linoleum it might be better.

  Been looking for a reasonably priced cordless hard floor cleaner. This had good reviews and seemed comparable in function to competitor. Was simple to operate, doing the job as hoped. Due, I presume to the battery, it isn't as light as I would like.  For doing local area cleaning, the battery charge of ~25 minutes is adequate. For doing multiple rooms, intermittent charging is necessary between use. Overall, satisfied with purchase.

    Great for a no carpet house
  
","









  
  
    
  Just moved into a house with all hard floors, so I didn't want to deal with mopping the whole house using my Libman mop (washable pads, on board cleaning solution that you spray as you go).  This Tineco cleans very well!  I swept before I mopped the first time, and I couldn't believe the guck I still had in the dirty tray!  The water was almost black it was so dirty.  Thankfully, subsequent mopping produced considerably less dirty water and much less guck.  My house is fairly small, around 1,300 sf.  I was able to mop the whole house on one charge and two containers of cleaning solution.  Also able to go over the kitchen and main room twice, which I did because I couldn't mop the whole house on one clean solution cup.  Cleaning the parts after mopping is also easy.  Everything comes out,  is easily cleaned and then reassembles without a problem.  You do need to let the parts air dry first, or there will be a smell.  Lesson learned.Wish I could say the same for every model carpet cleaner I've ever owned...

    Overall worth it with a few minor design flaws
  
","









  
  
    
  Pros: I love this thing. It' so nice to not have to vacuum before scrubbing my floors. Such a time saver overall. I love the self cleaning feature as well. & personally I think the battery lasts longer than what it says. The suction is definitely great & it definitely cleans better than any other hardwood cleaner I've used. My floors look so much better. I also love that it uses so little of the cleaning solution per tank. The talking feature is probably unnecessary but makes it feel fancy & nice that it tells you exactly what it needs.Cons: I wish both the clean & dirty water tanks were a little larger bc I feel like I'm constantly emptying/refilling them. & I also wish it connected to the charging station better. When I set it on the charging station, it picks up that it's on there immediately & says ""charging has commenced"" & then checks to see if it needs to run the self cleaning cycle.. If it runs the cycle, you're required to empty the dirty water tank again, only problem is that when you slightly bump it to remove or replace the dirty water tank, it starts the ""charging has commenced"" & checking to see if it needs to run the self cleaning cycle all over again which can just end up being an annoying never ending cycle. Also when it self cleans, if you have pets, it definitely still needs a solid wipe down around where the roller brush connects (still so much better than others I've had though)... The fur just really collects there. We have real wood floors so the divots between the planks seem to be deeper than laminate & light ring seems to get thrown off by those divots & will turn red when I run it across them & it seems like it struggles with dark grout in between tiles as well but I didn't buy it for the ring feature. The only other nit picky thing I can say is that I wish they included a harder brush roll instead of 2 soft ones for things like day old drop of spaghetti sauce that hit the floor & I didn't get to type of thing, sometimes it just doesn't scrub hard enough & I still have to get down & scrub with a hard sponge or use my hoover floormate that has harder bristles to clean up.Either way I definitely recommend it. I've talked 3 of my friends who have pets & muddy-boot boyfriend/husband's as well & I have no regrets. I don't have kids but I'm sure if I did it would be a life saver.

    Works great but has its flaws

  I have all tile floors, 1900 Sq foot, cleaning wise it does a great job BUT the tiny tanks have to be refilled (clean water) and emptied (dirty tank) multiple times during one use. Then i have to do the self clean in between each one as well.. time consuming & frustrating so I do not use it as often as I had hoped, better for cleaning one area at a time which I rather do it all at once. Would be better with larger tanks or for a smaller house/hard floor area.. Battery lasts thru the whole house so that's nice. The clean after use is also a bit much taking it all apart washing and let dry and then reassembling. I'll stick with my o'cedar mop & shark vacuum. Wish I didn't spend the money on this but Lesson learned!

  I bought this based on all the rave, but I’m not personally understanding the hype. I have to change the water and refill the solution several times throughout a cleaning session. The battery doesn’t last long enough to complete the house(1,800 sq ft total, not all tile/hardwood); not even long enough to finish the living room and kitchen! As for “recognizing” dirty spots, I had a very clear stain/dirty spot on the floor and despite my efforts to get the tineco to recognize the spot as dirty, it wouldn’t. Overall, I just prefer my o cedar bucket and mop.

  I'm really excited about this new toy.  I hate mopping and I also hate dirty floors.  I have two kids, a cat, and a dog.  And a Dyson, which is sort of great, except I still need to mop.  Not anymore.I was skeptical about this wet vac but am talking it up to all my friends now.  It's easy and perfect for keeping the kitchen and high traffic areas clean.  I love the feeling that dirt from my floors is depositing in the dirty water tank than spread around by a mop.  My floors look and feel great, and I can walk barefoot again.  It even picks up pet fur.The one drawback is its battery life.  I wish it was longer because the first few times I ran it for a deep clean, I tried to get a big area but needed to recharge the unit.  Now that I'm doing more maintenance cleaning, it's fine.

  So I got this about 4 days ago and have mopped rooms multiple times because it’s so nice! I am in love with cleaning now. The cleaning solution has a very pleasant smell that stays for a while. It’s so nice walking into a room you have cleaned and keep smelling that clean smell.I recommend not vacuuming up larger/dirtier than usual areas before starting to use this. It is able to pick up dog hair and other debris but it will clog faster than starting with light dirt.Compared to a steam mop this is by far better! The steam mop just pushes the dirt while this mop vac sucks up the dirty water.I also tried this on the carpet where one of my dogs threw up(I know eewww!). I picked up the larger peices and used this to finish. Amazing at how it picked it up! No scrubbing on your hands and knees. (I have temporary, cheap, dark grey, flat “office” carpet where this mess was)Last but not least let it charge completely before enjoying! I was so impatient to try it and the battery died quick🤪. Fully charged gave me plenty of time to mop my house with time to spare.

  I have been super hesitant about spending the money on a vac-mop for months, finally decided to after days of rain and mud. I wish I had gotten one so much sooner! I have laminate flooring and it uses less water than I do with a regular mop, it dries in 1-2 minutes. The auction power is great for bringing the water back up and the maneuverability is great with the swivel feature. You can’t over fill the water tank or lean it too far back or it will leak, which is a totally reasonable thing to work with. As for deep cleaning, if you have something like dried ketchup on the floor, I advise to scrub that by hand if you have laminate or let it soak if you have a waterproof floor. The vacuum will not scrub up long dried on messes.I have two dogs and two kids with lots of in and outs, mud and messes. My boxer is a slobberer and like to drink then walk around the kitchen dropping everywhere. A quick run over with this and the floor is no longer slimy.

    It Works! A True Back Saver!!

  I'll admit to being very skeptical about this product. We have three dogs and all hardwood, tile, and laminate floors throughout the house so keeping the floors clean is a real chore, especially during Virginia's ""mud season"" which is roughly from October through April. After a lot of reading of reviews, watching video reviews, and comparing this to the Bissell products, I made the decision to try the Tineco Floor One S3. I'm sure glad I did!Pros:- Super easy to assemble.- Lightweight- VERY quiet!- It does exactly what it's supposed to do... clean the floors without leaving a mess and dry quickly - no streaks!- It cleans itself after you're done.- Dirty water tank is very easy to clean (please dump it into the toilet, not your sink!! It captures all of the dog hair and gook on your floors which will clog your drains)- It picks up thick dog hair with no problem and doesn't clog- It uses very little water but still does a great job cleaning!- Uses very little cleaning solution which saves you money- Battery lasts for quite a while (it says 35 minutes, but it cleans so fast, I've never had to use it all up yet)- Max mode scrubs well- It doesn't scratch your floors- SO MUCH EASIER THAN A MOP AND SO MUCH FASTER!Cons:- Tineco cleaning solution never seems to be in stock (I haven't had to reorder it yet, but I have been checking their website daily and it's often out of stock)- It doesn't quite get to the edges of your floors. You might need to do a little cleaning at the edges on your own but this is pretty simple all things considered.  Overall, I couldn't be more pleased with this product. I'll check back in a few months and update this review if anything changes, but it is a lifesaver. If you have pets of any size and a lot of hard floors, you will thank yourself for purchasing this. While it is expensive, it is worth every penny. I highly recommend it!

    Excellent vac mop. LOVE IT!
  
","









  
  
    
  This works great for everyday cleaning except it cannot get off stuck on messes. I use it on porcelain tile. It cleans great and leaves the floor almost dry. Self cleaning function works awesome. I do not think the sensors are very accurate though. It does not get down into grout, very close to edges or really scrub the floor hard. But I do not mind any of those negatives. It is an excellent vac mop. I love that I can just mop without vacuuming or sweeping before. I use it about every 2 days and it keeps the floor very clean. A little heavier than I expected. Feels about twice as heavy as a handheld cordless Dyson, but not hard to push at all. The self propelled function is awesome. It is easy to clean out. I would recommend washing it out after each use and leaving the brush roller part open to dry and air out to avoid any stink. It is a lot easier than a regular mop and bucket. I still use my OCedar on occasion but this works so well and is awesome!I can clean my entire tile areas of roughly 2500 sq feet on a single charge and refill water 1 time. It is a little bit of a hassle to empty the tank and the machine does talk A LOT. I do wish you could mute it because it does have lit icons if it needs water or to empty tank, etc.I use it to clean the floor regularly and to pick up spills and messes of all sorts. It is very expensive but it makes my life easier so I do not mind the price. I have been using it for 2 months now and love it!

    Finally-Clean Floors!!!
  
","









  
  
    
  I rarely write reviews, but great products deserve mention.  After using countless other products such as brooms, vacuums, swiffers, mops, shark steamers, etc. there is finally a swiss army knife for my hardwood floors.  I was skeptical at first, but this thing works and works very well for 90% of my needs.  I sweep, vacuum and steam my at least 3 times a week.  I usually sweep first, vacuum and then steam clean my floors twice to ensure I have cleaned up as much dirt as possible, yet I always felt like I am just spreading wet dirt around.  After doing this process, I used the Tineco and man, this thing sucked up some dirt and a lot of it.  I always suspected this, but the water was filthy and I couldn't believe how much grime this sucked out of my hardwoods.  I cleaned the machine and pad, then used it again a few hours later and it was the water was still pretty brown.  The third time did the trick and now my floors are looking brand new again.  For kicks, I spilled some coffee , dirt from my vacuum and coffee grinds on the floor and this worked as advertised.  The only thing it doesn't do well is scrub out tougher stains/pots like splash of coke that is dried up, but once you get those few things up with some elbow grease and some stronger cleaning solution, this thing does everything else.  In summary, I absolutely love this machine.  My cleaning time has been cut but more than 50% using only one device and I now know the dirt is being removed instead of being slopped around.  I no longer have that sticky feel under my feet and my floors look as good as new again.  Highly recommended!  I just hope it lasts for 2 years or more.  Only time will tell.

    Vacuum doesn’t connect to charging base
  
","









  
  
    
  This product was great the 3 months it lasted. Vacuums and mops great BUT I had so many issues that for the price seemed EXTREMELY RIDICULOUS. Within the first week the machine gave me an error message I called TINECO they gave me instructions went to try and vacuum was magically working again. Then I had an issue with the vacuum connecting to our wifi contacted again no response, voice assistant stopped working and finally the last and worst the whole vacuum stopped charging. Which means I have about $400 sitting around 🥲🙃 contacted TINECO and have had about 20 emails back and forth with them. They’re supposedly sending me a charging base, we’ll wait and see if that’s the actual issue.

  This wonderful product has made my life so much easier! I have two dogs (one is a very heavy shedder) and two cats so fighting the hair on the floor is always a problem. We have all vinyl plank flooring so sweeping and then going back over to mop or steam it took a lot of time. This cuts the time in half and does a great job on getting the hair up and leaving the floors clean. Just be ready to go when you turn it on because it’s self-propelled and eager to get to work.I think the only thing I would change is to have a larger clean water tank. Since it is self-propelled and there is no need to push it I think the extra weight wouldn’t be a problem and it would save time by not having to stop and fill it so often. But that’s a small complaint for all this machine does for me.The self cleaning feature is really great. Just put it on the docking pad and hit the self clean button. Cleaning the dirty water tank is easy and fast.The only problem I found is that it does leak dirty water back on the floor if you stop it and let it sit. For that reason I always wheel it directly to the docking pad when done so dirty water doesn’t get back on the floor. After that the self cleaning takes care of the problem.I researched the internet for similar products extensively before making my decision on this model and I’m so glad I did. I highly recommend this machine to anyone. My husband used it for the first time the other day and gave it an enthusiastic two thumbs up as well.

    Amazing wood floor wet vacuum
  
","









  
  
    
  Cleans really well- I used to use swiffer wet jet- it would take a lot of “man” power to press down hard and get the floors clean . This is really easy and light weight.  It pulls so you can feel the power it has!The only down fall to me is the battery life- only last 20-25 minutes(but the website/manufacturers tell you that so I can’t really say I didn’t expect it) .It’s amazing how much dirt it gets that you didn’t know you had!!Love it so much!

    My real hardwood floors look amazing!
  
","









  
  
    
  This is amazing! I have a salon with real hardwood floors. I was skeptical about how much water was going to be left on the floor. After using it for the first time, this thing is a game changer! I can’t believe how much it vacuumed up and how perfect my floor looks after the water is sucked up. There is barely any water left on the floor at all and it dries quickly. There are no streaks and no hair left behind. It has cut my cleaning time in half. I recommend this to anyone with real wood floors and even ceramic floors, what an amazing job it does!  The vacuum is light weight and had plenty of charge for the entire salon.

  Just okay. Got it to replace my bissell crosswave that I wasn’t happy with. It’s not any better than the crosswave and the battery life was significantly worse so I ended up returning it.I have all hardwood and tile flooring and the battery life would only allow me to do one small room or half of a living room at a time.It did not work well on stuck on food or dirt messes from my kids and pets.Ended up getting a bissell steam mop which works better than anything else I’ve tried for a fraction of the price.

   I can not say enough good things about this product. Extremely easy to use and works so well. We have a long haired dog so sheds constantly. I used this vacuum 2 days ago when it first arrived and was shocked at how much filth it captured after it had only been 5 days since I mopped. The video I posted is just 2 days later..... it is a little gross cleaning out the hair from the vent when the hair is wet BUt... other than that it's amazing! I love all of the features and how easy to use it is. My 6 year old even loves to help clean floors now.

    Battery life is questionable and NOT easily replaced.

  At first my wife loved this product. It did everything it advertised. But after a little over a year the battery started to rapidly discharge after the battery level hit 70%. Then it would drop RAPIDLY until dead. It took 2-3 days before it recharged. Tineco would take it back to repair, but we would lose our warranty time while it's in their shop. Plus they will reimburse a max of $25 to get FEDEX to repackage it for shipping. We have lost our enthusiasm for this product.

  I bought this cordless wet/dry mopping vac to replace my corded Bissel Crosswave.  WOW, am I glad I did!  This thing cleans very well and it knows if you need to pay extra attention to certain areas by giving a few more passes until the color ring tells you its clean.  In ""auto"" mode, it knows to turn up the spray and vacuum power.  the self propelled operation is a nice bonus with the ease of maneuverability.  It's lightweight, quiet, and you will be shocked by how fast your floor dries too.

  I clean my floors so much more now because this is super easy to use and eliminates the hassle of the spin mop. It does a great job cleaning the floors and the vacuum is impressive too! No problem with batteries. Sometimes I vacuum before to make it easier with a real vacuum because I have a dog but satisfying results either way. The cleaning solution also smells really good. The only problem is it can’t get into corners…in the picture you can see the outline so I go back and wipe down those sections but it’s still so much easier! Overall floors at my house are much cleaner now since my purchase, I would definitely buy it again and could not live without it now.

  It's a very good vacuum cleaner. It sucks the ground very well. I have a cat in my house, and I need to clean my hair at any time. This vacuum cleaner is very suitable for families with pets. It is very convenient to suck and mop the floor. This vacuum cleaner is helpful, so it doesn't need too much effort to control, which is very friendly for women.This vacuum cleaner is also very good-looking. The wireless operating system is very convenient, and battery life is good.When I use this vacuum cleaner, if I don't want to mop the floor, I don't need to add water. If I want to mop the floor and add water, it's very flexible.

  I love this machine! It is easy to use, does a great job cleaning, and is easy to clean after finished vacuuming. It has shown me how filthy my floors really are! I like that it came with an extra roller and filter since they take 24 hours to dry before the next use. It’s also neat that it has a designated storage area for the roller and filter to dry so it doesn’t take up my counter space. I’ve never been more excited about using a vacuum!

  I had wanted this for a while, and was pretty excited to use it. Everything seems to be working as it should, but after the first use I don't look forward to using it anymore. The handle is short, and it hurts my back having to bend over the entire time using it. My normal vacuums don't have this issue. I am 5ft 7. Other than that it works great, cleans nicely, I wish the bins where larger but it works for what it is.

  I have serious buyers regret with this vacuum/mop. I wish I knew how to return this thing to be honest. The number one complaint I have, it smells SO BAD if you don’t take it apart and let the little filter dry out every time you use it. It’s the worst smell I’ve ever encountered. It’s not like I’m going over smelly things, I have a tiny one bedroom apartment with hardwood floors just trying to get up crumbs and dust.It also repeatedly tells me to fill the water tank or empty the cleaner tank even if I just filled it or emptied it. My husband hates it so much he ask me to turn off the volume, which I don’t know how.I literally hate this thing and I’m about to put it out in my apartment hallway for someone else to pick up for free.

  We have hardwood floors and kids & dogs so I'm sweeping and mopping almost daily and this thing is a game changer!! We had a Bissell crosswave that lasted about 3 months and then broke. So this time I did a lot of research before I spent another $300 on a mop. The suction and power on this thing are crazy! And I love to see all the hair and dirt it picks up and dump it down the toilet. The self cleaning feature is so cool! I Seriously called my sister over to show off my tineco and gave a little demo. I'm way too excited about this floor cleaner but it seriously makes my life so much easier. now she's getting one

  This little machine rocks! Excuse the gross hair, but I have a doberman, a black cat and black chihuahua ""all shedders"". I have a built in vac and for the last 12 years got on my hands and knees to wash my wood floor weekly. Obviously it never sucked up between the  wood seams to deep clean. This sucked up everything and my floor looks shiny new and it even squeeks.  Well worth every penny. Plus it moves on its own SO EASY and QUICK!  . A+++

  I have owned this for a month or so now. The unit stopped turning on one day and turns out the handle just decided to pop out? Once I reattached it started working.  One week later is has a slow drip from the dirty water basin.  After I fixed that, the suction is now making weird noises (strong weak strong weak).I do really love this vacuum mop.  It’s so quiet compared to the cross wave. I just wish I wasn’t having so many problems with it.

  Dear friends- I've been using iRobot Roomba for years and have always been a big fan of them. However, I am very skeptical with mopping machines. It just happened I watched a Tineco's video on Tiktok and it looks really tempting so I decided to give it a try.I am shocked.I am shocked by how easy it is to use, to clean, and how clean it makes my living environment to.Strongly suggesting this product although $399 ( after tax is about $430 ish? ) is definitely a bit pricy.But if you could afford it and you like to be in a clean environment, this is a life saver.

  You require we buy your solution for a $400 mop or it voids the warranty. That’s cute and all yet you don’t keep it in stock. Whatever the reason, if you can’t keep the cleaner in stock, you offer full refunds to all customers or you remove that little disclaimer about your warranty being voided. It’s actually unbelievable...I have referred SO many people to make this purchase and I’m regretting every single one of them.Go ahead and blame it on covid.

  I was really excited to get this, but I actually miss my BISSELL crosswave! The tineco is absolutely horrible at sucking up dust & dog hair.. I have two German Shepard’s, so that’s a problem. My crosswave would’ve sucked it up no problem. The tineco spits it right back out & im left having to pick up hair globs myself. It also doesn’t get stuff that is stuck on the floor off. I am constantly having to use my foot to rub something off or my fingernail to scrape something off because the tineco just doesn’t do it.. The crosswave always did! And not to mention I haven’t even owned it a year it’s already no longer charging. Reached out to tineco multiple times about the warranty claim I submitted & have never heard anything back. Awful customer service!

I feel so much better about the floors my baby is crawling/walking on. The only thing I'm not loving is the fact that it doesn't get into corners or up against walls that great, but I can live with it for sure. I'd say if you are debating, just buy it!Note: The photo attached is just from me cleaning JUST my hallway which is about 12x2.

My only issue is for ground in dirt, it doesn’t clean very well and I have to use something else to get it up with like a sponge with an abrasive pad.

    Light weight and high efficiency

  My 7 year old Bissell Powerbrush vacuum started to leak, so I decided to give this highly recommended & kinda expensive brand a try. Fortunately I'm lucky and got a hit. It's worth the price.This Tineco wet dry vacuum is lighter weight, and way lighter than my old Bissell wet vacuum. It's much more easy to manipulate than my old Bissell.It works efficiently, cleans well on hard wood floor and tiles surfaces, no complaints.In this Tineco, the dirty water tank is vertically installed at the bottom of the handle, it is a better design than my old Bissell that has a dirty water tank on the bottom of the vacuum body, which is why the Bissell has to be always very carefully used horizontally otherwise the dirty water all spills out and causes mess, versus this new vacuum totally avoids this problem. I love this convenient feature a lot.This wet dry Tineco vacuum is cordless, my old Bissell has a long cord, not a deal breaker, but I'll definitely prefer cordless to a long cord. The battery lasts long enough to finish a medium size three br house.Overall I'd say it's worth the money, and of course it would be nice if it's more affordable.

  I need to amend my original review, it just quit working after only 6 1/2 months, neither the power button or self clean buttons would work after I turned it on this morning. My advice now is DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!! Our floors are cleanee than with the swifter wetjet, it's light weight and no cord are also plusses. I haven't had any problem with the small tanks or it needing charging too often. However, I am disappointed that it doesn't clean right up to the floor molding, stays at least an inch from the edges. Also, it needs to self clean too often, we have no pets or children in our home, just two adults but sometimes the self-clean light comes on after just a few minutes. I do recommend this product, it does a great job on file and LVP.

I am previously a sweep the whole house and then use bissell steam mop.Pros: ease of useExcellent suction power, very surprising!!Self clean featureCleaning brush has the flip out hook/blade in the end to get hairs off the brush roll if they have wrapped aroundOnly takes small amount of cleaning solutionBattery charge lasts a long timeFloors dry quickly!! Doesn’t leave a lot of water, even when you turn off there are NO puddlesCons:Misses about an inch in front of and to the sides when you use against the base boardsDoesn’t clean hardened sticky messes like a hot steam mop will so I think for a super deep clean the steam mop would be needed. But if maintained clean floors with tineco frequently then wouldn’t need a deep clean from the steam mop!For maintenance at the end of each day I spray a  50/50 bleach and water solution in the dirty water tank and on the brush roll and rinse out. Let the brush roll dry completely at night outside of machine.

    This vacuum is multifunctional and saves me time.

  This vacuum cleaner was very easy to assemble and it doesn't take up too much space. It doesn't need to be plugged in for it to work and that is very useful for cleaning around the house quickly. The vacuum automatically goes forward when you put the handle down a little bit which is good if you do not want to push it. The vacuum cleaner is very easy to clean and it says what is happening like if we need to clean the vacuum it will say it is dirty. The vacuum's battery life lasts a while so I can clean the whole house and still have plenty of battery percentage left. I have a golden retriever and he sheds alot and this vacuum cleaner can quickly clean up his hair. After I’m done washing dishes, I can use the vacuum to clean up the floor. I don't need to sweep or mop anymore because this cleaner is 2 in 1.

   This machine was great the first few times. Then water started coming out of everywhere. I also don't know where the soap is coming from since the provided Tineco solution doesn't seem soapy (makes me think I could've gotten a used machine?). During use, the Tineco asks me to stop and clean it so I do....multiple times. Only to return to the machine on the docking station with water EVERYWHERE underneath it. I've cleaned and changed the brushes and the tanks. I've reached out to Tineco customer service for help. With all of these great reviews, maybe I got a dud?

  I saw many people using this on tik tok and really wanted it.  The Tineco is great! It's really gets into my textured flooring for a deep clean. While it's mopping it also picks up all the dog hair I have around the house with it's awesome suction power.It will also clean itself but I usually go back and cleaneverything myself just so I know that the dog hairs hasn't clogged anything.The only negative thing I would say about it is that when I turn it off and does leave some water sitting in the floor, I'm sure it's a user problem but I'm not sure. I usually just get it up with a paper towel after.You can use really any cleaning products in the Tineco although the directions say otherwise (I'm sure that's a selling tactice)

  Absolutely love my tineco! I love being able to vacuum and mop at the same time and my floors have never looked cleaner. I was able to show my 13 and 15 year old how to use it and even they comment on how quick and easy it is to use. We have lvp in our entire downstairs that is about 1200 SQ ft and we are able to clean the entire downstairs on one charge. My only complaint is that it only takes the tineco cleaning solution and it seems hard to find in stock right now. The tineco did come with a bottle of the solution though and it only takes a small capful so I think the bottle will last for a while. It also doesn't require for you to use the solution every time and you can use just water if you want.

  I know it might sound silly to be so excited about a cleaning product. But I am in love. We have concrete floors through our entire house 1650 sq foot  & this is my new best friend. We have to dogs , kids and live the farm life. So this I use daily. It has been such a time saver for me. I have a lot of medical issues so it being so light weight and easy to maintain it a huge plus for me. The only issue I have found at all that truly doesn’t bother me a bit is sometimes around the rollers at the ends where they snap in our long hair will get slightly caught but I can pull that right off no problem. The battery life is great too. I clean my entire house and still have 64% battery left.I was nervous about spending the money on this product but I am so glad I did😊.

If you have animals be prepared to dig wet hair out every time you dump the canister (it does pick it up good). I do like this sweeper/mop combo, I just wish I would have bought the cheaper model that looks like it does the same thing for 1/2 the price.

  Every time I have company over and they see how easy it makes cleaning, they go home and buy one. The amount of therapy I would have needed to not feel overwhelmed by spills, gooey and sticky food that can’t be swept or vacuumed, and general cleaning would have cost significantly more than this machine. With 3 small kids and a dog this thing has been worth EVERY PENNY. Last night at 1 am one of my kids peed all over the bathroom. This cleaned it up in seconds and I went back to bed. The only downside is it vacuums but doesn’t mop along the edges. So when I wipe baseboards I scrub that 1 inch of floor along the walls.

  Where has this been all of my life??? Bought it thinking it couldn’t do what it says it does, but it vacuums AND mops your floor. Clean up of the machine afterwards is easy and quick. As per the video online, your floors will pass the paper towel test afterwards (no dirt left behind). I have told all my friends to buy it, now I’m telling you. I did not buy the wi-fi version, don’t need it. Also, if battery life seems short at 25-30 minutes, let me tell you, I can clean the whole bottom floor of my house in 15 minutes or less. If you have pets or children, you need this thing.

  I was between a 2-3 stars based on the price.  It works better than a Swiffer, sometimes better/sometimes not as good as a standard mop.The fast drying is a plus, but the amount of cleanup for the machine itself is too time consuming.  I had to dump the waste tank and refill the clean tank about 4 times when cleaning our small amount of square footage downstairs, and run a self cleaning twice in that time.  I was able to get our smaller downstairs space cleaned and a small amount of our kitchen on one charge, now I've been waiting a few hours for it to charge back up so I can hopefully clean my kitchen, dining room, and living room without needing to charge again. . . .With the price of the device it should either hold a longer charge, or recharge at a faster rate.  I noticed that it also does not scrub up deeper soiled spaces on the hard floors (when a basic mop could take care of it with a little extra scrubbing).  It works okay, but I really wanted it to perform better for the price.

    Great timesaver to clean hardwood floors

  This product is easy to use and talks you through the steps of cleaning/care of the item. There are different “wells”, one for clean water+solution and one for the dirty water. They are not very big, but easily hold enough water/solution to clean a large room without stopping. We love that there is no sweeping/dust pan step or wringing out the mop, or spaying solution on the floor to mop over. It’s all in one machine, in one step. The floor dries quickly and auto-detects need for deep cleaning (more water+solution and increased power to spin the brush) with ease. Your eyes cannot always see the need to deep clean and we love how it detects this need automatically. We have two dogs and have been using our Tineco daily for spot pet clean-up, and whole floor every couple of days. It’s so easy to use and glides with little effort across the hardwood floors, you don’t feel like it’s a chore!

  This vaccuum/mop is THE BEST! I love it. It's easy to use, easy to clean. Everything about it is easy. I cleaned my floors and the first time the water was dirt black. It was shocking because I mopped 5x a week with 2 kids/2 dogs who shed a lot. I have used it numerous times and now the water is a light brown. That shows that it's doing it's job better than any mop I used. I used to vaccuum or sweep and then mop. Took about 30 mins to do both. This machine cuts that down in half and my floors are always clean. I had seen some some reviews about it streaking the floor and I figured out this happened when you put more than the recommended cleaning liquid. If you use the capful they recommend there is no streaking. Would highly recommend!

  I really thought this was only for people whose house didn’t really get dirty. You know, the people with no kids or pets who live in the city where dirt and mud don’t track in every day?But this thing really works! I have a toddler whose favorite pastime is flinging food, a large breed dog, two cats, and people are constantly coming in and out of the house. In New England, we track in a lot of mud, sand, and salt. The tineco can handle all of it! I got this based on the vacuum wars review on YouTube, and now even my husband (who was originally opposed to this purchase) says we can't live without it.  My floors are cleaned so much more often now which prevents everything from tracking all over the house. I will never not have a vacuum mop again!

  I purchased this because it has better reviews than the Bissell Crosswave. All in all I really like it. I used it on tile in our kitchen, dining room, walk in pantry. It left the floor clean, non streaky, not sticky/tacky, and it’s pretty light weight- I’ve got back issues and usually vacuuming makes it worse- not so much with this. Once I get the hang of it and the best time saving way to go around the house with it, I’m sure it will be better. I have 1 complaint, and 1 suggestion/wish. My complaint is that I used it until the battery got down to 1%, set it on the dock and followed the prompt to do the “self-clean”. Except it told me that it didn’t have enough battery to do so…… even though it was plugged in. I called customer support and was told that it needed to be at least 30-40% charged to run the self-clean. Makes zero sense to me. Once I’m done using it I want to be able to clean it- not wait an hour or more. ESPECIALLY since it was on the charger/plugged in. My suggestion would be that it would be nice to have a way to plug it in while using as well- like a cord option.

  This is the best thing on the planet! I have two dogs and a toddler and no longer stress about my floors. It was always such a drag to sweep and then mop. It was so time consuming that I didn’t do it as much as I should have. Now I do at least 1 room a day. You truly don’t have to sweep first. The display ring is red when the floors are dirty and turns blue as the become clean. I did my mud room floor first and then wiped it with a clean paper towel, there was nothing. Very clean. It’s doesn’t leave a big wet mess behind, is lightweight and insanely easy to use. It literally tells you went you need to empty the dirty water bin, or fill the clean water. When you’re finished, it runs it’s own cleaning cycle and cleans itself. I recommend it to all my friends have and family. If you take good care of it and use it as it’s meant to be used, it will be a dream and work beautifully.

  I love my Tineco! It has saved me so much time cleaning up messes from kids and dogs! It’s great for spot treating big spills and on MAX mode sucks up the stuff in my grout! However, my complaint is that although it cleans well it doesn’t get the edges or corners of the room nor hard stuck on things like candy. It also does leak a small amount of dirty water onto the ground sometimes. I do however appreciate that it is relatively easy to take apart and clean. I think everyone should have one but I do think improvements could be made on the product.I should also note we have a long haired GSD that sheds horribly. If you have a dog that sheds in large amounts you will need to take the roller off and scoop out a bit of hair at times. It’s very simple to do and doesn’t bother me much. The self cleaning works well but often there is hair stuck behind the roller. Either way get it! My floors have never felt cleaner.

  If there is anything I bought right in my life is this Tineco. I had bought the Bissell because I thought it was the best. I thought wrong. This Tineco is a life changer!!!  Believe me when I say YOU NEED TO GET THIS!!! It makes cleaning so much easier you save so much time!!! It leaves me floors so clean I can’t complain at all. Love it so much

  Pros: light weighted wireless, quiet, use less than 50% battery to clean 1,300 square ft.Cons: clean water tank is too small, need to use two tanks to clean each time. I wish the dirty water tank can separate the dirty water and the trash. It’s nasty to pull all the wet trash out from the tank.

  We have been using this for a few months now and I definitely love it. We have very dark hand scraped bamboo floors and it doesn’t leave ANY streaks. I love how I can vacuum and mop in 1 simple step. Between children, pets, & farm life I am always cleaning. The assemble process is very simple and comes apart easily for clean up. The machine hardly has any crevices for dirt and debris to become lodged in. Loved it so much I convinced several friends and family members to order it.My ONLY complaint is that it doesn’t clean directly against baseboards, cabinetry, and transition pieces on the floor. It leaves a 1” gap on the floor that isn’t clean.

  I am a huge fan of this machine. What an easy way to get your hard surface floors clean. It’s easy to use and cleans well. Gets a star knocked off because you can’t get close to edges. It’s almost a 2” gap next to walls or rugs. Also the “voice assistant” is irritating. You know how you’re ready to go home from work and you go to turn off your PC but then Windows decides you can’t close the system without doing a 20-minute update. This cleaner is sort of like that. You think you’re doing and putting it away and then you have to wait until the voice assistant tells you to do a cleaning cycle which can take 5-10 extra minutes. I just want to be done when I’m done.

    Sweep first if there's a lot of pet hair
  
","









  
  
    
  This does an excellent job as long as there is nothing stuck on too firmly to the floor.  I have 3 cats and two dogs, and even if I have swept the day before, the pet hair clogs the dirty water reservoir and or the brush at the bottom, which is a minor pain. I do love how the dirty water is separate, and it does a bangup job of cleaning around the cat box. It gets about 60 of my black slate floor, which is good enough for in between real scrubbing.

    Great Product with an annoying drawback!
  
","









  
  
    
  Pros: This is probably the most time saving product you can buy. Vacs and Mops at the same time! I read a review somewhere and it mentioned this particular vacmop excels at cleaning dirt from the edge of the floor. That's very true, indeed it can pick it up very well and save you time! I wish the tanks were a lil bit bigger, but it's not too bad tbh. Battery life has been amazing, I only use it on hard floor as I already own a carpet cleaning vacuum.Cons: I don't know if anyone here has mentioned this, but you need to remove the brush roller after almost every extended use (extended = more than 2-3 minutes) and dry it outside, in the sun! Why? Imagine your good old mopper, if you do not dry the mop, or rather keep it damp between uses, your entire house is going to stink! The brush rollers are very similar to the ones you use for painting drywalls, and the way this thing is placed, it's impossible for it dry on its own. It stays damp for several days even without use. After the self clean cycle, take it out and dry it in the sun, else your house is going to stink!The CON mentioned is a general product drawback, not specific to Tineco. However, since it still exists and don't see much done about it, taking out 1 star. Perfect product otherwise!

  Super easy to use. I love that I don’t have to sweep/vacuum before mopping up my floors. Now that my 1 y.o. is eating on his own there’s a mess on my floor after each meal. But this Mop/vacuum makes clean up easy and a breeze. I’m confident enough to let my LO crawl on the floors once I’m done using it. The concentrated formula provided works amazing!My only downfall is the small tanks but it’s not a deal breaker. I usually mop with a normal bucket and mop once a week for a “deep clean” and use my Tineco everyday twice daily and it’s holding up so far.I love it. You won’t regret. Suction is even better than a Dyson.I have the Dyson11turbo and honestly the suction on this Tineco beats it.Buy it now!

  Really like this wet dry vacuum.

  It arrived as scheduled. It was really well packed into the box. Everything was in the box and it was easy to put together. I have used it three times and it is working extremely well. One minor issue was that Tineco is out of the cleaning fluid. The S3 does not use very much, but I decided to order another bottle just so I did not have to worry about it later. The website said it was sold out. I contacted customer support using chat, which worked fairly easily and was given a specific date when it would be back in stock. Overall, we are very happy with the S3.

  I love this thing!  I hate mopping because you have to lug water around I have a large house with loads of dusty hardwood flooring.  I was able to do my whole first-floor kitchen dining room study and front entry on one charge with time to spare.  The best part is how little water you need.  I did have to fill and empty the tank a few times but it's easier than the big bucket and mop. Love the self-cleaning feature. It is a little tricky to get the dirty water and cleaning bin back in but once you get the hang of tipping it a little to click it in you will be fine. I have had it for a couple of weeks. I feel comfortable recommending it highly I just got my mom one.

The only other problem I have is if the trap gets too full dirty water will come out of the bottom which isn’t a big deal because I just suck it back up. The charge lasts to do my whole house, a little over 1300 sq ft. It’s kinda overpriced, but it’s easy to use & the dirty water comes out really gross. I love the self cleaning feature!

  Best cleaning tool I've bought in years. Arrived weeks earlier than expected. Did not expect this thing to do as well with pet hair as it does! I do wish that it could get closer to baseboards etc but I can handle a bit of manual work!The only thing I would change would be larger tanks and the ability to shorten the handle. I'm 5'3"" and it's just a bit long for me.

  Love this! It is a must have for families with littles and pets. This thing eats green beans, rice, other foods, cat hair, and cat puke like nothing else! I should have bought it ages ago!  It's great for immediate clean up, but if it's dried on, you'll need to spray something on it ahead of time and then it will destroy it! I only wish the water tanks could hold more. So impressed.

  I hesitated on the price too. Do it.  It is so light weight, so quiet, yet so effective.  I just love it.  It's not a brush, it's roller, which threw me, but it works great.  It uses very little water so my floors (hardwood especially ) dry very quickly.  It's self cleaning which is super cool and SO easy to take apart for a deeper clean.  (I clean the roller by hand as well)It's battery operated and cleans my floors without needing a recharge.It's great.

  Stopped working after 5 months with a message to call customer service. Still under warranty but the only problem is customer service is nonexistant. When you call it says leave a message for a callback, but they never call you back. Over priced crappy product with crappy support. Dont waste your money.I'm updating from 1 to 4 stars because after sometime I did get a return email. After a half dozen messages back and forth, including me sending a video of the non-working machine, Teneco did authorize a replacement machine. Just had to send the broken one back first.

  I purchased this item 8/21/20 and I loved it while it was working. Unfortunately, it stopped functioning properly just before Christmas. It will cut on, run less than a minute, and shut off and it doesn't pick up any longer. I checked for clogs and can not find anything that should be stopping it from working. I tried contacting the company by their phone number and it immediately puts you on hold listening to elevator music and no one responds to email ever!. At first I thought I wasn't getting a response due to the holidays, but, now it's 1/25/20 and I just attempted to call again and again it went to the elevator music and never got a person. I paid $299.00 for an item that was supposed to be excellent and yet only worked for less than 4 months (just long enough that I can't use Amazon return). Wow, if I could leave a zero,I would!

  I searched for months, comparing the Tineco vs. the bissell and finally treated myself to this. I take care of my 9 year old as well as my mom with dementia so I need something to make my life easier where possible. First day I got it, I was so happy and mad I waited to long, BUT Not even a month later, it keeps prompting me to self clean even though I have, multiple times. Took it apart, air dry, try again the next day. Wipes it down with a damp cloth. Switched out parts for clean etc. Tried it without solution. Everything!  Emailed, no response. Called and finally talked to someone and unfortunately none of the resets helped. We emailed back and forth with me sending the same info and pics etc.  So now not only am I out 400$, I have to find someone to come sit with my mom to go buy a box, and ship via fedex. They couldn’t mail me a label, nor box. I’m a little pissed this new machine has to be sent to be “fixed” and sending the machine back. I feel with the a sound of amount spent, I should get a brand spanking new one and send the old one back with that box since it’s obviously a dud. What else is going to mess up in a few more months?

  This tineco was amazing at first but the longer we've had it the more issues we've come across and we've only have it for 4 monthsThe bad:1. Charging: The cleaner sits on its own designed charging base and over time the upright position on the vacuum is leaning forward further not allowing it to charge properly.  I had to place an object under the front portion of the charging base so that it leans backwards far enough to charge.2. Self cleaning: because we are having troubles with charging it is causing issues with the self cleaning feature as well.  The only way you can use the self cleaning feature is to put it on the charging base and while it's charging the vacuum will run its own self cleaning feature. Since the vacuum is having a hard time charging, the self cleaning feature hasn't worked because it doesn't charge.3. Leaking: the vacuum now leaks when it isn't on. So if we leave anything inside the vacuum when it is stored there is a puddle on the charging base that we need to clean. Also, when we are transporting the vacuum back and fourth there is now a trail of water the entire way we need to clean.4. Tile: we have a bathroom with a tile floor on it and the vacuum is not very good getting the deep grouting between the tiles. It leaves that area wetter and stuff in the cracks more.  I only recommend using it on hard wood floors.The GoodThe unit works well on hardwood floors and on messes that have not dried.  If there is a recent mess than needs to be cleaned and you grab this vacuum it will work perfectly to clean the messs.  It can pick up entire carton of eggs broken on the floor, a gallon of milk, whatever you can think of.  If the food/drink/etc has been there a while and it is dried to the hardwood floors, then it won't get it up. You will either have to get it up by hand or spray something on it, let it sit there for a bit, then use it again and it will work.  Most other mops have a harder scrubber on them to help get those spots off.Overall: the vacuum is WAAAAY overrated for what it is.  It isn't worth $300 and I'm glad We got it for $125 off. Go get a shark steam mop and be happier!!************Edit 12/18************Now the plastic head on my unit broke rendering this unit completely useless. Really appreciate your amazing craftsmanship Tineco round of applause.

    Real Review from a Real User
  
","









  
  
    
  If you’re looking for a permanent mop/bucket substitute, this is NOT for you. I’m a mom of 4 (ages 11-17) with a dog and cat. This is great for those “in between” deep cleanings or cleaning up a spontaneous mess on the floor. This does not get up against baseboards, doorway ledges or where cabinets meet the floor (kitchen, bathroom, etc). There’s about a 2 inch “untouchable” area on the sides and front of the brush head that will not be cleaned.I’m keeping this for 2 reasons:1. I love how easy it is to grab it and zip it around to do my quick cleanups. It’s simple to use and simple to clean the unit afterwards - just give the detachable pieces a quick rinse and let dry. The slower you move this, the cleaner the area. Don’t go too fast or you’ll pass over general smudges on the floor.2. The amount of time I save is incredible. While I can’t use this as a substitute to deep cleaning, I’m not having to do those as often. The floors aren’t soaked and they dry very quickly. Since this “sweeps” as it mops, I can have my kitchen and living room done (swept, mopped and DRY) in about 20 minutes. Sure beats filling the sink up with solution/hot water and going back and forth with a mop and then making everyone stay off the floors for another 30 minutes or so until fully dried. Plus, using this to maintain the floors, makes a deeper cleaning not as bad and definitely not as often. Get this! Don’t get rid of the mop and bucket, but definitely get this.If you’re looking for a negative point, I’d say it would be how often I had to do the self cleaning mode in the beginning. BUT, I’ve found that the cleaner the floors, the longer between self cleanings you’ll have to do. So expect the first couple of times to take a while but once you get to where you’re using this every 3-5 days, those self cleanings will be fewer and far between. If you think every 3-5 days is a bit too often to clean your floors, you’ll enjoy the “results in minutes” aspect so much and won’t mind cleaning more often. (It takes longer to do the dishes!) I haven’t had an issue with battery life and I’m contemplating getting a second roller just to have. And while the cleaning solution seems to be difficult to find, it smells really good.So if you’re like me and you’ve compared this with other brands and models, keep researching until you’re comfy. I wish I could’ve been able to afford one of the newer models, but I felt this was appropriate for the money and honestly, I’m pretty satisfied with it. I’d be willing to fork out the extra money if this actually did the deep cleanings that we all have to do by getting up against baseboards - maybe have a rotating brush on the sides and front for those untouchable areas. Hope this helps.

    It's BEAUTIFUL!!

  I was so excited when I received this.  I've been using the Bissell CrossWave for the past 2-3 years and loved it for the first year but now it's not performing effectively so I decided to try Tineco iFloor3.  First off, it's BEAUTIFUL.  I love the sleek design and how modern it looks.  It's light enough that it can easily be moved from one room to another.  The buttons are in the right spot and it's so cool to see them light up.  So space aged :-).  It practically moves by itself so there is very little effort when washing your floor.  And, it seems to do a good job vacuuming and washing the floor.  I only wish the tanks were larger. Tineco - why did you make the tank so small; it's hard to fill and it empties too fast. I have a lot of area to clean and it's not convenient to need to refill the cleaning tank right in the middle of washing the floors; it doesn't hold much liquid.  And, the battery only lasts about 20 minutes yet it takes 4 hours to charge. I think this would be perfect for a small kitchen or condo or any smaller job.  The floor area I need to clean is over 1200 sq feet so I don't think this little machine is going to work out for me.  I REALLY want to keep it so I'm trying to decide if I can do part of the floors one day and more the next.  I'll have to say this, I used the Bissell Crosswave in my kitchen and then used the Tineco over the same area and the Tineco picked up more dirt.I would recommend this 100% if you don't need it for a very large area.  Still undecided but I would love to keep it if I can figure out how I can get all the flooring cleaned in a timely way.

  I love this as it it has made cleaning so much easier. I have around 1700 ft of porcelain title and hated that every time i would mop there would always be streaks but with this tineco  one s3 it barely leaves any and is so are not to noticeable . i love i just fill tank and start mopping. I do have to refill water tank 2-3 times and same to empty dirty water but i do not mind as that is done in a min. The battery last exactly to clean my entire house i do have to charge for a bit to be able to complete the self clean and make sure to clean filter and brush afterwise. It does come with 1 extra filter and brush so after i clean them i let them dry and put in the dry and clean one. I do recommend it and do not regret buying i just wish it could clean the corners better as it does have around 1 inch space in brush and would not clean right net to the wall's base.

  If you are like every other person I know, it will stop working. It won't keep a charge. It will give you error messages and will shut off. For spending $400 on a machine that was only used less than 12 times, it is just not worth it. (I am elderly, have a 1000 sq ft home, a maid that comes and uses it every other week for the 6 months I am here. I have no pets and I have a robot vacuum, and do not cook in the house - so no grease, no food messes.)I called customer service. Customer service had me do severa things after which I was told I had a defective machine. They said they would replace it. After 8 days, they emailed an expired shipping label. When I asked they re-issue, they apologized and, a week later, sent another expired label but told me I had 7 days to ship the defective machine back. That is when I discovered I couldn't fit the machine into a box. I tried to buy one at Walmart but, it costs $42 to buy 5 boxes of that size and you cannot purchase only one. So, I requested they send me a box. After all, their customer service had already told me it was defective. IAE, after another week of waiting for a reply, Tineco has informed me that my defective machine was purchased a year ago so they will ""depreciate"" it. They will also deduct the price of the shipping from my refund. I know 2 other people who bought this item. They also have ""defective"" machines and have been told to ship back for replacement. I'm beginning to think the entire thing is a scam.

    A helpful tip to current iFloor 3 users
  
","









  
  
    
  I've used this mop for awhile now and it does a fantastic job of cleaning EVERYDAY messes. I read through the negative reviews and noticed people complained about the self cleaning light coming on during mopping. Guys, just bc the light comes on does not mean you have to stop in the middle of mopping to run a cleaning cycle. Just ignore it and run it at the end when you are finished mopping. Also, when running a cleaning cycle you don't always have to add the capful of cleaner. Plain water works well along with monthly deep cleaning on the mop itself. Keep in mind that the clean water and dirty water tanks are small so you will have to empty and refill if you have a large area to clean. If you use it on MAX the clean water and dirty water tank, fill up and empty a whole lot faster. Does this replace deep cleaning and scrubbing your floors? Of course not. Nothing can take the place of a plain mop, scrub brush and elbow grease. All in all this is an excellent machine for every day cleanups. I love it.

  Pros:- Quick clean up of floor messes after my toddler eats or a spill- Self clean feature is nice (I wish Dysons had a self clean feature)- Definitely saves time and I can quickly get the floor of two- to three rooms done on one charge, depending on the size of the room- Before having this, I would have to vacuum and then steam mop, very time consuming. I still do this sometimes because I think the steam mop is better to be honest, but I can use this in between and still feel like my floors are pretty cleanCons:- Doesn't do a good job with dried on messes (my steam mop does a better job)- A lot of parts to think about and there is a learning curve in the beginning; you do have to make sure to take it apart and let the components dry or else you will have a smelly mess- Can't clean carpet- You have to buy the solution, which is not cheap (unless someone knows an alternative?)

  I have owned a Bissell Crosswave for 2 years and this new machine is so superb it’s not even in the same hemisphere. This machine is awesome. It vacuums like a regular vacuum and it actual has a force that pulls it forward with absolutely no effort from me. It cleans so thoroughly you don’t need another machine. It is so light I can carry it with ease (and Ive had 4 back surgeries) to all 3 levels but my favorite it the Self cleaning. The Bissell has a very small cleaning cleaning roll and no matter what I did it had a smell when I used it unless I washed it every single time and take the roller out and let it dry. Not with this machine. You put it on the stand, which is the charger not a separate cord, hit self clean and this machine cleans itself and I don’t have to dismantle it. The charge lasted long enough to do my entire house which Is a ti-  level with oak floors, vinyl floors and laminate thru out. Just so you know I have 3 older little dogs and have messes to clean and it does phenomenal!!!! No smell and cleans it so well one swipe and I’m done. BUY BUY BUY!  I love it!!!

  I just received this and tried it out.  I have large tile throughout the house and area rugs.  I just pulled up the area rugs and cleaned the rest of the exposed tiles.  The tiles under the rugs are nice and clean and the machine got the other tiles just as clean-effortlessly.I used to use those mops with pads on the bottom-they were horrible.  They’d slip off, and spread sand everywhere.  This sucks the dirty water off the floor.  I am very pleased with the results.Obviously there is a little cleaning of the machine after you use it, but it’s easier than cleaning buckets/sponges/rags.  Cleanup takes a minute or two.After you use it once and clean it once, it’s super easy.If you’re on the fence-get it.  I am so happy I did.  I am going to order another roller so I can have a dry one ready to put in so I can use it whenever I need it.My floors feel so clean.

  I like the self clean mode but i feel as if it doesn’t really get the brush roller clean without several self clean cycles  i also was extremely disappointed that it doesn’t clean all the way against the walls it leaves like an inch or two gap where the floors do t get completely clean so i have to go behind it and use my regular  mop to clean up those areas however o do like the fact that it can be used for a quick spot clean. Living with high tragic areas where  there is constantly dirt on the floors from people going in and out of the house is and being able to have one device to do everything even deep clean my floors  was the main reason i asked for this as a birthday gift as a mom in a house full of young men in and out it’s a constant struggle to keep the floors. Clean i just would prefer the gap issue from th wall and  machine  be reconsidered as an improvement and also larger water tanks so your not having to stop and empty the tanks And refill them every few minutes

  I have ADHD, so most of the time I get overwhelmed just by the thought of having to vacuum and then mop...which means it usually just doesn't get done until hyper-focus kicks in and I aggressively clean the house top to bottom The iFLOOR3 takes away that anxiety and I have cleaned almost every day since it arrived (my husband is amazed). I knew my floors were dirty but DANG I didn't know just how dirty. The day it was delivered, I did my hardwoods 3x until the dirty water collector was only a semi-murky color instead of the gross mud brown it had been the first clean.Pros- Can see the filth that you're mopping up- lightweight, semi self-propelled- easy to set up & store- good battery life for the areas I need to clean- light, pleasant scent to the cleaning solution- works well on hardwoods & vinyl (would probably be great for tile too, we just don't have any in the house)- dries quickly without streaking- can also clean the kitchen fatigue mats (this is a BIG plus for me)Cons- doesn't get flush to the wall/baseboard; leaves a 1"" gap unmopped- have to Self Clean at least once during each cleaning session (maybe my floors are just that dirty IDK)- doesn't do well with stuck-on messes (great with dried dirty paw prints, not great with week old jelly/sauce)All in all, the iFLOOR3 is awesome. The edge gap irks me, but that's something I can live with. Would absolutely buy again.

  LOVE this product. I was hesitant at first because it seemed to good to be true. I even let it sit for about a week before trying it out. I'm in my late 50's and have arthritis so cleaning my floors is rough. 90% of my house is hardwood, laminate, and tile, so cleaning my floors, well... I have to do it twice: sweep, then mop.  Its a job. And, I have two large shedding dogs. We had a period of a ton of rain and so I really let my floor go where my dogs come in and out. It was a mess. One of my dogs also loves to bring leaves in the house so it was really bad. I wish I would have videoed the cleaning. I couldn't believe how this wonderful machine sucked up the dirt and cleaned the floor. SO impressive! It was like one of those commercials where you really don't believe it works that well.  Well, I can say it does. Life saver for me and worth every penny!  Cleaning it is no trouble either and the self cleaner is really cool to see how you think its clean, and then it runs and wow...

  The unit is well built, with good instructions and does a fine job cleaning marble floors in my case.  The amount of dirt and gook it picks up is impressive.  On the downside it is somewhat cumbersome to clean and you have to wait until the various parts dry before you use it.  I recently experienced a unique issue where I had to clean the inside of the water tank.  The washer which interacts with the main unit and housing cover over it became dislodged so my unit is currently unusable.  I am waiting on a new water tank for you cannot easily put the washer back in for it is an enclosed plastic container.  There are two openings, one to let the water and cleaning solution in, and the other to let the water gradually enter the unit for cleaning.  Supposedly their latest model has a different water tank design.  I would recommend the unit.

  Need to vacuum or sweep if you have pets. It’ll suck it up but it prevents itself from doing as good of a job mopping. Otherwise it’s perfect, it talks you through what to do and very easy to clean and put together. Way better than my dyson that dies after 8 minutes

  Omg. Seriously,  my wood floors were only a couple weeks old when I got this. And I mopped daily! This made it look like I hadn't cleaned the floors in years, the brown water it sucked up was disgusting! You could lick the floors after if you wanted. I will never go without one ever again. I've even used it on a chocolate milk spill on a white rug as a quick pick up, I didn't even have to use my small shampoo er. This got it all up.

  I have too many great things to say about this machine!!! I just received it yesterday and used it today. What used to take me at least 2 hours took me maybe 20 minutes today. I used to have to use my wood floor vacuum and vacuum my entire downstairs first. Then get my bucket, get my mop and basically spread the floor gunk around until I thought my floor was clean. Well it wasn’t clean. I was just spreading filth is circles until it looked “ok” in my eyes. This machine left my floor CLEAN!! No residue, no trails, no dog hair. I have 2 large dogs and they leave the floors a mess on a daily basis. They will continue to do this but because of the convenience of this machine I can easily clean up after them on a daily basis. This machine is lightweight and not near as loud as my regular vacuum. It’s already charged and ready for me tomorrow. I can’t believe I waited so long to get this! Also, so easy to clean! It’s self cleaning! I’m beyond excited and my age must be showing but geez this gave me back enough time to write this review and catchup on my show so I wanted to share with y’all. So pleased!

  I have about 2500 sq ft of wood look tile, 3 kids and one dog, and this is a life saver. It’s easy to use so I can pull it out for small areas, or do a whole house clean. Yes I do have to stop and let it self clean often, but that only takes two minutes. I usually vacuum first, but this picks up stuff my vacuum misses too. The floor dries very quickly with no water puddles. It has seriously made me so much happier with my floors!

  It cleaned my porcelain tile really good, but I have two German shepherds and their tumbleweeds of hair were not easily sucked up by this unit. It either just made it a wet ball on the floor, got stuck on the roller, or clogged the dirty water tank. So you will have to sweep up dog hair before using this. Otherwise, still got up more dirt than my old bissel.

  Saw this reviewed on TikTok, and special Amazon Prime day pricing. We have 4 dogs, and was using a Shark steam mop the was leaving a dull finish - not cleaning well at all. The Tineco iFloor3 is the BEST floor cleaner that completes the process in 1 step by not having to vacuum first. Easy to handle, clean and dirty water compartments. AMAZING brush roll self-cleaning process! My husband is in the flooring business, we were *almost* going to replace to vinyl plank but now we have the beautiful luster of the engineered hardwood again. Looks fantastic!

  Just when I thought 2021 could not be worse than 2020, I broke my leg (surgery required to insert a metal rod). The floor is not cleaning itself, and housekeepers not available (pandemic!). I figured if this product works as advertised, even just a couple times, it'd be cheaper than housekeeper sessions and safer.And OMG it is true. It sucks and mops, grabs hair, and I can have a conversation while cleaning on my recovering leg. No more Roomba bumping into walls and furnitures aimlessly. No more Dyson being the conversation stopper (can't hear a word).Sister in law was visiting and thought I was perhaps ultra deligent and clean with a house guest. No, I was showing off my new toy. I asked for 7 minutes and Viola, she's sold.

  This is truly a revolutionary product! Best purchase this year. Before I bought this, I used the combination of Dyson and iRobot mopping robot to routinely clean my kitchen floor. But I still have to manually clean with wet towels and detergent in the old school way minimally once a week and sometimes more often. And the mopping robot cleaning pad is not cheap. With this machine, I can mop the floor as often as I'd like and the result is amazing!!! I have had it for two days and everything about this machine is superb. The only remaining test is durability.

Why did I mess around with hand washing and conventional mops for so long?It’s lightweight (maybe 12lbs?) so easy to get up the stairs.

  I love this vacuum/mop. I have two cats and a bloodhound and the animal hair is real. Our entire house is hardwood, so it's almost impossible to keep the floors clean. Our home is about 1500 square feet and I can do an entire floor on one charge, probably part of both floors but I haven't tried yet. I do wish the tanks were bigger, but it's super quick and easy to empty/fill them, so that's not a big pain. If you have major spills right against the edge of the floor, you might have to spot clean by hand but otherwise it's perfect. I highly recommend this.

  This is the best purchase I have made in a very long time. I HATE to mop! This is the best invention EVER. It mops and vacuums at the same time. My floors have never been cleaner.

I never thought they were that dirty...but I was amazed at the dirty water that the Tineco picked up the first time I used it!

At first, I thought I was doing something wrong I followed the directions and always pre- vacuumed my floors but after reading some of the reviews it sounds like we all have a similar problem.The vacuum runs for 3 second and then cuts off saying  ""clean the debris channel or call customer service."" Unfortunately, they don't answer the phone and you're asked to leave a message. I have left 2 messages and have yet to get a phone call back. I wish Amazon would take this product off their shelves so no one else would screwed paying $400 for a piece of junk.

I do a pre vacuum just so I don't fill this thing up with hair but if you had minimal dog hair It would be just fine to not do a pre vacuum.

  I loved the product but it stopped working after 7 months. Customer service has been terrible and not timely. They told me I was eligible to get a new one due to failing troubleshooting help but they have not sent the return label nor have they responded to me about just getting a refund and I’ll order another on here faster than they would get me one. Again, I love their product but with the price you pay I would expect it to hold up longer. I also am very frustrated and disappointed with their customer service who I have spent emailing all week about it and we have not resolved anything yet. They also will not take calls 😑

  I had BISSELL CrossWave Pet Pro Multi-Surface Wet Dry Vac for 3 years. Old, Wired Model. Actually It was good and did a job. No complain. But my new one ""Tineco Floor One S3"" is absolutely awesome. Main thing - it is wireless. So much ""Freedom""!Also is is VERY, very quiet - comparing with my old Bissell. Cleaning quality is better too. Also water suction is much better - so dirt pickup is better and floor dries much faster.  I like voice guidance - helps to remember all things that need to be done for using it and maintenance.I have it just for one day. Love it. Hope I will not change my first impression in a future.

  Had to order and return twice before it worked. Finally the third one worked. I bought it cuz it came highly recommended. I think it’s good as an overall daily floor mop. It does not deep clean. If you have tough spots the mop will not clean it. The suction is ok but it doesn’t get anything along the sides. I think it’s a good concept but has where to grow.I got it for $130 off. If I paid full price I would be very upset with the quality. It’s very expensive and doesn’t live up to its price point.Also must clean out dirty water tank and behind brush roller every day or the unit stinks!

  I had hoped this would be a game changer, since my entire first floor is either hardwood or tile. But, on the kitchen floor if there is anything more than a spot it won't get it up. And let's be honest, in your kitchen there is often food that falls to the floor and gets stuck there! It also feels like a lot of trouble to completely dismantle and clean after every use, plus the self-clean light comes on after just a few minutes of use every time. I vacuum my entire floor at least 2-3 times a week, so it can't be that dirty. I think it's probably pretty good on the hardwoods. It definitely takes less physical effort than mopping, but I still find I need to mop my kitchen to truly get it clean.

  After allowing some time to make a review I’m disappointed after 8 months of making this purchase to find out later how many negative reviews were accurate.Upon receiving this vacuum I was ecstatic and in love. A few details to help aide your decision making and how this product stood up against the elements.Purchased in April 2021Single individual with a baby Pomeranian living in the city of Chicago with a unit under 500 sq ft and with no kids.I’m a pretty intense cleaner and use a dyson for pre hair pickup so that the machine isn’t working so hard.The battery charging plate broke within the months so I have to hold the vacuum just right to fix it.2nd offense - the cleaning solution is forever out of stock and not local for purchase. Any other brand will absolutely ruin the solution tank which I learned the hard way. There’s no available replacement part for this.3rd offense - even after cleaning weekly the water sprays out as I vacuum causing an even bigger mess.4th offense - my water tank broke all before 8 months of owning this machine.5th offense - it can’t detach to clean in tight spots and will not clean all the way to the walls. You’ll still need to mop.Honorable mentions - do not clean up pet messes as the machine will forever smell. It’s best to pickup/wipe up and then clean with the vacuum. There’s an investment in replacing your parts regularly like the rollers so factoring that is important.Overall it was not worth the investment and lacked longevity or feeling like it was cleaning as well as it did the first month of owning it.

  This is an early review -- I just received my Tineco and used it for the first time yesterday. I will update this review if anything changes over time.But as of today: AMAZING!I have a 9 y.o. son and 2 dogs so my floors are heavily used. We have hardwoods, travertine tile, and ceramic tile in our condo. This appliance is a life (and back) saver! The self-propelled nature of it means I cleaned both bathrooms and the kitchen floors yesterday and my back feels great!The only area where I see any lack is the ""deep cleaning"" aspect. There were areas of the floor where I still needed to get down there with a wipe and a little elbow grease.That's a very fair trade if I never have to mop again!

  I love this as oppose to a mop and a broom. Its cordless and its powered to move forward so you are not having to push and pull, bend down and up causing aches after sweeping/mopping a whole house. Its an easy slight push to guide the machine. It twists and Turns and can get into small crevices. easy to figure out how to clean and add water/soap. It is not for a deep cleaning, definitely doesn’t work miracles on stains. For the everyday easy spills and sweeping needed, its great! It does have some water streaks and it does not get dirt close to the baseboards, but it does a pretty good job. Suction is great and its so easy to place it on the base when done to recharge. Definitely recommend

  I am a cleaning nut. I can’t stand to have anything dusty or dirty. But I got so tired of having to vacuum and then mop all on the same day. My whole house is tile and I have two small dogs. The Tineco Floor One3 is a very powerful devise. I was so super Ed and thrilled when I saw what an amazing job it did. Picked up all the very small dog hairs and when I did the self cleaning for the roller, it got all those little hairs out. I did not expect that. I thought I would have to clean that with a brush separately. As far as streaking, I had non of that. I only used 1 capful of detergent.I should have bought this sooner. It is my favorite cleaning devise along with my steam cleaner.LOVING IT!!!

    clean sensor is just a gimmick and customer service is terrible
  
","









  
  
    
  There is no reason to buy this. The sensors have a known problem and the company does nothing about it. They sent me a label and that was it. The stated after I ship it they will complete the fix in 1-2 weeks and then ship it back. the whole process would take a month.All of this was after I had been emailing them about the faulty unit for over a month. They would request my personal information and the product SN over and over, after I provided. If I did not send it each time they requested, they would not answer my email.the product is decent except for the sensing technology. My suggestion would be to buy the cheaper model or get the much more reliable bissell crosswave vac-mop which is far more reliable, cheaper, and with great customer service.This company makes little effort after purchase, despite having some of the most expensive products on the market. So in this case, YOU DO NOT GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR

I have wood floors and a dog and a busy house and being able to skip the step of having to vacuum first and then mop is the first WOW factor but when I saw the completely disgusting dirty water from my first use (and just from my kitchen) I was mortified and then freaking ecstatic!  This just made my efforts to keep my house/floors clean a breeze! I cannot recommend this enough. It’s lightweight and super easy to use. The only sad part is that I haven’t had one all my life.. ps I rarely write reviews and I am suspicious of reviews that are a little too excited and happy 😆 I wish I could give you my contact info so I could tell you that I’m a real customer and this is a real review

    Amazing for the ocd

  So far the only thing I don’t like is that I do you have to change the water out a few times even while doing a quick 10 min clean. If that’s my biggest complaint I won’t really complain because I am able to do my entire house in under 20 minutes vacuum and mop at the same time! I already vacuum twice a day so this has seriously helped me in so many ways. Immediately after I mopped my dogs ran through with muddy foot tracks it took two minutes to get them sparkling again with this machine.  If you clean your floors all the time yes get it. We have polished concrete and I even feel like they look buffed after.

  I bought this floor cleaner. I just can’t clean my floors like I want to.  I have arthritis and find it more and more difficult to keep up like I use to.  Anyway I did a lot of looking and searching through reviews. This blew away the crosswave in reviews.  I had been eyeing that for a while.  We bought this so I can keep our floors Disinfected  and deodorized.  And it’s amazing. I can not say enough good about it.  One sweep of our kitchen floor and this is the water. It really bothers me that when our granddaughters visited, their feet were so dirty from just running around in my house. We wash that floor every week thoroughly. But I guess not doing a fantastic job. I ran this once through the kitchen and entry upstairs and this is the water..... yuck 🤢. I’m thrilled with this and it will make a huge difference in our house!

  First- I looked at these in November but didn't justify the $300 price tag. I opted for the Shark VacMop for $75 instead. I found the pads for the shark were $1 each and needed at least 5 to do the whole down stairs. Don't even get me started on the pricey solution. Every time I mopped I was disappointed.I finally pulled the trigger on this Tineco after reading a lot of reviews. The first charge took awhile. I should have plugged it in yesterday and started cleaning today, but I didn't so I ended up recharging a few times today. But to be fair, I cleaned all the downstairs floors (kitchen, dining room, massage room, both living rooms and bathroom) and upstairs (our bedroom, bathroom and laundry/craft room) and the garage landing! That's a lot of floor.Coordless- the docking station is super nice. Nothing to plug in, just clip the mop in and click the self clean button. Awesome.Self propelled- does a really nice job and saves my back!Solution- only uses 1 capful per tank. Cleans well. Doesn't leave residue.Tanks- only major complaint here- small tanks! The clean  and dirty tanks are small and need refilled/emptied often. But.... considering the alternative to pushing dirty water around, absolutely worth it.

  Overall, this machine is a win. I originally purchased the crosswave but it just left dirty water all over my floors. I have two Great Danes and let Me tell you, they bring in so much mud and dirt from outside with their giant paws.  This thing has worked wonders in keeping my kitchen clean. A few downsides is that it only ships with one roller, I’d recommend buying a second. It also does not get close enough to the walls so you have to spot clean the corners and about an inch around the walls. But overall, a good machine. I registered the project and hoping that if I do have issues in the future then the company stands by their product.

  I cannot believe how strong this little thing is!! I’m in love! I joked and told my husband I was leaving him for my mop in which I named “Elliot” from the show magicians. My grout on my ROUGH tile which hasn’t been “deep scrubbed” (I hate getting on all fours with a scrub brush to clean the grout) in at least 2 years, was HALF way cleaned!! It will need deep cleaned in order to be completely white again, but I bet the mop would keep up with it after I did. I’m so impressed by this mop. I felt sick spending this much on something I wasn’t sure would work but I told myself “it can always be returned” but I don’t think I will EVER give this thing away unless it dies on me 🤷‍♀️

    Decent Machine
  
","









  
  
    
  This machine does vacuum and mop in one step however it requires frequent dumping if dirty water and the clean water tank is too small. The battery also doesn't last as long as advertised. I only got 25 mins miximum out of it. Not sure if mine was a defective one or not.  It isn't as loud as I expected it to be. Overall I would like it more if the clean water tank was larger size and if the battery lasted longer or at least have an option to have a detachable battery so one could purchase an additional and extend the run time 🤷🏽‍♀️.  I haven't tried the bissell one so I have nothing to compare it to. There is also a 1 inch gap between the machine head and floor wall so it will not get the edges... For the amount of $$ you would think it would get all the floor area 🤦🏽‍♀️.

    Great for perfectly flat floors, TERRIBLE if you have recessed grout lines with tile.
  
","









  
  
    
  This would be great for hardwood or other smooth surface.  For tile with recessed grout lines, you can do five passes without even getting the grout lines wet, much less clean.  Avoid for tile with grout lines.I have over 35 wireless devices, and this is the only thing that would not connect despite repeated attempts.The Bissel has a deeper nap to the roller and it does OK with grout lines (but does not always pick up the water well in the grout lines).  The deeper nap may allow the Bissell roller to last longer as well.  Tineco returned, Bissell kept.By the way, WHY is there an ""e"" in the middle of Tineco if the damn letter is silent?

  I really liked this unit and I used it once per month at most.  After a little over a year it died (engine fault).  Still on warranty but they don’t replace it (like roomba) they want you to dismantle it and pack it and ship it to them for repairs and wait. I get to look forward to having a defective machine sent back to me and if it dies again I will go through the entire process again. I had trouble with my Roomba (more expensive item) and their response was “we are sending you a new one” period. No need to even return the damaged one.  I know where I will spend my money next time and it won’t be on a Tineco product

    Best daily cleaner ever
  
","









  
  
    
  This is the best hardwood cleaner that I've ever owned. The cleaner is easy to use and easy to keep clean. The cleaner has a self-cleaning mode which makes it easy to keep the rollers and intake clean.  The batteries last about 30 minutes which just a enough time to clean the floors if you use it daily or every other day.  If you use it less often more dirt builds up which means that you will cover less area. So far I've used just the recommended cleaner and it seems to work very well. I use it just on hardwood and tile floors. I have not used it on regular carpet but I have used on a low nap carpet. It's easy to remove the roller and just let it dry.

  Yes I said it. A mop changed my life. I show this off to everyone who comes over and even make videos of me cleaning up messes my little ones make. It’s that good.Picture this. 2 year old throws milk, sticky rice, and applesauce on the floor. It effortlessly vacuums the food up and leaves a beautiful freshly mopped glow.My house has hardwood and tile. My floors are swept and mopped DAILY.Before buying this? I vacuumed. But mopped…. Very rarely.NO WAY could I keep my house up without this.Then it self cleans itself? I still take the brush apart and everything bc I want it to stay nice and perfect.JUST BUY IT.

  I REALLY wanted to love this machine as every inch of my house has hard wood floors. I was so excited when it came I immediately unboxed it and tried it out!Does this thing Vacuum!? Sure!! Does it mop? ABSOLUTELY NOT.We are an active family with 3 children, 2 dogs, and 3 cats. We love to be outside and eat together at the table so naturally our floors get DIRTY!This product could even get dried ""muddy"" prints off the floor, nor day old spaghetti sauce from our two year old.100% DO NOT RECOMMENDstick with the dyson vacuum and Bissell steam mop. Somethings ARE too good to be true :(

  This product is amazing for our EVP/LVP and tile. It makes cleaning SOOO much easier. We vacuum constantly with little kids but used to hate mopping bc it was an extra step. Not only is it two in one so saves time, it’s just generally easier than the swifter/Bona type mopping.It’s also very light weight and the charge has never been close to running out (it’s easy to charge so it always fully charged between uses).It is important to be diligent about cleaning the dirty water tank but it’s easy to do.The only thing that is the same as typical mops is that you still have to separately scrape off anything on the floor that is sticky. The mop won’t typically be able to remove/pick it up.

    Works great until it doesn't; too many hoops to jump through for warranty!!!!

  I really like this vacuum. It does a very good job at cleaning floors- you can see it in the water that you empty out!However I hope that I got a dud, but it stopped working after about 10 months, and this is a very expensive item to be replacing every 1-2 years. I called customer service, and that said I was still under the 2 year warranty. Great! II went through the diagnostics over the phone, was not able to fix. I am told they will send me a new one and that I can send the old one back in the same box. So they send an email and ask for a video of it failing. I film the video and send it to them. Then I get an email back saying to try a few more things. I try those things and they don't work.Then they say they will send me a shipping label, and they never did.  I also do not have a box, so I ask for a box, and they send me a cube box that is too small for the length of the unit. Now I am stuck waiting again for both the box and shipping label.It would be nice if they would simply send the new unit and allow me to use that box to send the old unit back just like I was told. This is tiring.

  I’ve had my unit since October 2020.  It’s been pretty great and I liked it better than the Crosswave.  It has since stopped charging though…. I feel like less than 2 years isn’t good.  I’m so tired of throwaway products that are not made to last or made to be supported with aftermarket parts.  I see many others have similar issues with the charging base just stopping

  The not so good...If you have a large space to clean, you will not be able to finish within one charge especially since you need to stop and run a cleaning cycle often. This is fine, but it takes long to recharge. The dirt and clean containers are too small and fill up/empty quickly. I wish these were larger. It would have been nice to have the option to plug in rather than just wait for a recharge. Even if you purchased the more expensive machine with the additional 10 minute charge time (I ordered the middle priced one), it still would not provide you enough time to finish cleaning if you had a large space. Also, it does not get into corners or tight spaces.The good....The floors you are able to get to do in fact get clean. The components are very easy to dismantle and clean. The solution they provide works well and smells nice.

  We have big dust sweepers we use a few times a day (we live in the mountains and the dogs track in dirt etc on top of shedding their lovely fur). This machine is fantastic for my back because it’s self propelled. We use Swiffers regularly but this vacuum when we can see that it isn’t enough. If they bring in sap, I can just take the machine and hover over the bad spots until it’s gone. So easy to use and put away. I wish the battery could be charged separately from the machine for easier storage away from a plug but I still really like how this thing operates.Bottom line: I’d rather have dirty floors than not have my dogs. This machine is a must have to make those big mopping jobs much easier.

    Where Has This Been All My Life???

  I waited several months before writing a review so I could really use it and evaluate the good, bad, etc.Overall? I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS THING AND IT WAS WORTH EVERY PENNY!It has saved me Sooooo much time! No more vacuuming the floors and then going back and washing them. It works wonderful and the floors feel so clean! I spilled an entire bowl of broccoli cheese soup, complete with chunks of broccoli....and the Tineco cleaned up the whole mess like it was NOTHING!The cleaning solution is expensive, but you truly only need a cap full, and it smells wonderdul! I also have two very low-pile area rugs, and I use it on them as well. It's not the same as a full rug shampoo, but it does the job!If there are any cons at all? There is about a 1/8th - 1/4 of an inch gap between where the floor meets the wall that it doesnt reach, but I have never found a vacuum that does, so that's expected.  I'll also say, when they tell you that after every single use you need to rinse out and pull apart the dirty water tank, and brush roller assembly? Don't skip it! Like most wet/dirty things, it WILL start to stink and get musty after only a day or two.....but I have left the clean water tank filled with water and cleaner for several days at a time and it's fine.So ZERO REGRETS here so far!  Highly recommend and seriously one of THE BEST purchases I have ever made!

    Takes on 2 Toddlers and 2 Dogs Like a Champ
  
","









  
  
    
  I’m absolutely in love with this machine. My expectations were definitely exceeded. We have a 5,200 sq ft house, and it is almost all hardwood floors. We have two toddlers and two dogs. The mess is substantial...and sticky.If you are considering buying this, here are some things you may want to know:- The voice instructions are really nice. This machine will audibly tell you exactly what it needs. It is super smart, and takes the guesswork out of figuring out where there is a clog or why it isn’t working as well as usual.- The battery length is impressive. I can do my entire house (5,200 sq ft at a relatively slow pace) and still have some battery left.- This auto-propels forward. I underestimated how nice this is. Makes the effort that much less.- The auto clean cycle makes your job easy, but I do have to run it a few times during a cleaning session. Before starting a self cleaning cycle, make sure you have enough clean water in the tank and enough space in the dirty water tank otherwise it will make you start the whole cycle over again.- Run with the grain of your floor. This seems obvious to me, but there are some complaints about streaking in the reviews. Solves the problem completely. I get a beautiful shiny floor every time.- For the best clean, slow down a little bit. My husband uses this like he is racing the clock. It gives a nice clean, but when you slow down just a bit, you notice the best results.- Works on tile as well, but I think of it more as a refresh in our bathrooms. It isn’t going to get down to the grout like a mop. I still do a proper cleaning with some stronger cleaning products where we have tile.- Also works to refresh your low pile rugs. I had no expectation of this making any noticeable difference on my rugs. However, very pleasantly surprised.- It comes with a bottle of Tineco cleaning solution. It is a very light and good smell. The bottle has lasted me about 2+ months with near everyday use.- Empty the water tanks every time! It does not take long for the tank to smell musty. I think this would be the case when any similar product, but it is a pain when I’ve forgotten to empty. I run a few cleaning cycles in a row and the issue is fixed.Overall, 10/10 recommend. Our Tineco has handled some pretty significant messes. I anticipated pulling the mop and bucket out for a “real clean” at least once a week still, but it has been 2 months and I haven’t had to do it. Especially if you have kids or dogs around, this is going to make your life so much easier! Take the plunge and make the investment.

  I cannot say enough wonderful things about this floor cleaner! I was so so tired of still having dirty feet after washing my floors. Now, they are truly clean. It gets all the dog hair too. I feel good about having my littles roll & play on the floor. It takes me maybe 45min or so to do 2100sq ft of LVP.  I’ve had my Tineco for almost a year and you name it, I’ve vacuumed it, but it still works as well as the day I bought it. I do not only run the self clean when it’s done, but also thoroughly hand clean the different parts before putting away including cleaning out the debris channel. It is all super easy to take apart and clean, I feel like this machine was very well thought out when created in that respect. I cannot praise this thing enough!!!!! Definitely a worthy purchase!

  I have 2 small kids, 2yo and 5yo and they cant seem to eat meals without spilling at least half on the floor. We found ourselves constantly sweeping and mopping. I wanted a wet vac that would vac and mop at the same time and this product works great and has been a huge time saver. Its so light and easy to use that I don't mind cleaning up anymore as before it was just an arduous chore. The battery life is fine for our main level. The suction is great for a battery unit.  Our floors have never looked cleaner! My only recommendation is to have a heavy duty cleaning roller too for those hardened spills. Other than that, I love it. This is coming from the husband as my wife didn't inherit the  cleaning gene. I was considering the cheaper priced model but it was out of stock and I am so glad I bit the bullet and bought this one.

  I read a ton of reviews on Amazon and other sites about the tineco and the Bissell Crosswave before purchasing this item. Because of the positive reviews I bought this tineco and I have no regrets. I have used it weekly for the past three weeks. I have a 1600 sq foot home with all tile/hard wood floors. It is just my husband and I plus our Boston Terrier. The Tineco worked wonders on our floors and picked up dog hair! It did an amazing job. There was a spot by the baseboard that was dirty and the tineco couldn’t get to it. So I took a chlorax Wipe and cleaned it. I took the clean part of the wipe and wiped a part of the kitchen tile that the tineco had cleaned (out of curiosity). The wipe was clean! There was not any dirt on it! Amazing!!! This version of the Tineco tells you what it needs. It will tell you when to fill the water tank and when to empty the dirty water tank. I was able to clean my whole house on one charge. But I read some reviews that others could not. I had a friend who asked about the cleaner and the cost. It only requires one capful for each clean water tank. So the cleaner should last quite awhile. The first clean I had to add water about 5 times. My floors were dirty! The second 3 times and today only twice!

    As a vacuum collector, WORTH IT.
  
","









  
  
    
  My partner hates me. I collect vacuums thinking the next best thing will come along and improve my life.So far, I've bought a Roomba, a Dyson  v7 stick, various other cheap stick vacuums, a shark lift away. Those are just the ones I can think of. For mops, everything from a basic mop, to a Lipman refillable/washable, a spinning one.No matter what, my routine took me hours and left me exhausted. To be quite honest, I never felt swiffer/lipman mopped my floors clean either - just pushed the gross around... We rarely walk barefoot in the house because I just cant keep up. AND I MISS WALKING BAREFOOT!We have 2 dogs, and 1 (hairless) cat. That means needing to vacuum and mop constantly, like once a day minimum. With the Roomba it should've been easier but one dog attacks it and also piddles randomly (so didn't want the Roomba freeroaming on a schedule).Enter this. Man. I knew I would be in trouble for buying it and I did get the ""ANOTHER ONE?"" speech... But guess what? We now use it daily. It cut my cleaning time in literal fractions. Its easy to clean and its pretty much self propelling, so its like 0 effort to use it. I will say, the first time around I wish I vacuumed first, it clogged up a lot with the dog hair, but after that it wasn't a big deal.For comparison, I feel(but may be wrong) it has better suction power than the dyson v7 stick (go figure), and definitely better floor mopping than a swiffer wetjet(or equivalent) or a bucket and mop. I have wet the floor after and whiped with a paper towel and its still super clean after using the Tineco.I have used the included cleaning solution and it smells nice. It does leave a haze, but it also cleans well. I've also tried pure water, which also works fine.I wish when I got it I did NOT peel the sticker off the LED area - I had to put the manual on my fridge so I could readily see what it was telling me it needed. Other than that, not a big deal.I did my research and bought the iFloor3. It's pretty close to the same as the One s3 without the added cost. I felt I didnt need it talking to me, and I could keep up with the lower milliamp (mAh) battery. Although I wish I waited a week (theres a discount now, and I would've gotten the One s3). However, I can quickly clean my whole house on MAX with the 3000mAh battery, for a deep clean/messes I will need to charge a few times.It's light and easy enough to use for kids, and is a bit of fun to use, if you'd like to get them involved. I'd highly recommend this all in one floor cleaner.

Even with the max mode, it still does not get stuck on messes off my floors. Its too large to get under my stove and leaves a wide margin around the egdes of my floors where it cannot get. The air it is kicking out from the suction blows around the pet hair instead of picking it up. Its great for mud season, but other than that I would have to pass on buying this machine again. The brush when removed never seems to dry. It also needs to self clean every other time I use it to clean my kitchen floor.

  Im not a influencer. Im just some dude who is married with 2 kids and 3 dogs. My dogs are the ones that you can give a bath and they will instantly run outside and find the first dead or stinky thing they come across and roll around in it. I also feel like they think i need to see them throw up. Why they horse play outside till their hyperventilating than suck up 6 gallons of water only to throw up 4 of it up on the my floors is a complete mystery. Also they tend to have no time to finish pooping or take just a half second to get it all out before they take off running and playing. But i know they love to use my wood floors as their personal toilet paper. My kids are on the same level if not worst. So having the ability to vacuum up and mop at the same time is a freaking amazing. I have a dyson v8 and then used a swiffer. 3 hours later and some how my dogs found a mud hole in a drought. Long post but worth the money and im cheap. Good luck fellow person who is trying to find a genuine real non coerced review.

   For a parent with 3 kids under 5 years old, and a dog, I should have bought this in 2019 when it first came out. I can pick up WET food in the ground - i.e. rice, noodles, cereal, eggs (cooked and raw), and basically everything under the sun. Not only does it pick up food but it actually cleans the floor. And then cleans itself.We host a weekly small group with people in our home each week and it takes 15 minutes to clean the entire dining, kitchen, and living room area. The water coming up is dirty gray water but you wouldn’t have seen that even on our light laminate floors.With little kids crawling and playing on the floor constantly, this is a MUST. The only time I’ve ran the battery dead was the day it arrived in the mail and I cleaned for around 30 min. Otherwise, I have yet to run out of battery in a cleaning. I do have to empty my dirty water tank and fill up my clean water tank once during the cleaning. I love this thing so much I had my husband build a cabinet to fit it’s the plug in cord is long so it can reach pretty far as well!

    Pet hair, dust, farm dirt, or baking flour it gets it all!
  
","









  
  
    
  SEE the picture it will pick up all your pet hair! This machine was on my mind as a purchase for a month before I actually bought one. I have many reasons to buy one. I am a farmer in Wisconsin so we experience all seasons on top of that I also bake and decorate cookies out of my home kitchen. I have a dog who sheds all year, a three year old cat and two kittens so there’s no shortage of pet hair. All rooms are faux hardwood floor and endure pets, muddy boots, and the dreaded flour/baking powder mess in the kitchen. I have spent countless hours trying to mop daily and vacuum to keep up with the sometimes daunting mess or just the pet hair. So when I saw this product I watched videos and researched the product because at $400 it better work. Vacuuming was never enough because I also would need to mop after, plus there’s nothing more satisfying than a clean floor. Dragging a vacuum and then mop which still would leave some dirt/pet hair behind was annoying. I would have to walk around and wipe up spots with a paper towel to get what the mop didn’t pick up. So I pulled the trigger on the Tineco and haven’t looked back! It does exactly what it says! It cleans amazing and gets the job done where my stick mop doesn’t. It also washes the floor so it solves the problem of having to always use a vacuum and a mop. It’s great for everyday and it’s great for deep cleaning. The slight downfall is that the machine has a small clean and dirty water tanks. If I deep clean I am changing them often as I spend more time in each room. I am doing a general cleaning I only have to change the tanks 2-3 times which for me isn’t a huge deal, I’m usually close to the kitchen anyway. The other minor issue I have is that the cleaner for the machine doesn’t have a strong clean floor smell. There’s nothing like the smell of clean crisp floors and I really miss that about using this machine. I’m a month into using the Tineco and I’m super happy with it, it’s worth the money if you want to speed up your process and not use a vacuum and a mop as well if you have a high traffic home.

    Not for people with multiple dogs and overpriced
  
","









  
  
    
  I ordered the ifloor first version and it was terrible so I returned it and upgraded to this one. I wanted so much to love this but it's way overpriced for it's subpar performance. Do not buy this if you have more than one dog. I have an Aussie and her hair clogs it fairly quick. I'm still on the fence if I'm keeping it or notPros: self cleans, easy docking station, cordless, holds a charge long enough for me to mop 3 rooms, mops and vacuums at the same ame timeCons: kind of heavier than I was expecting, I have to empty the dirty water tank 2-3 times doing 3 rooms because the dog hair clogs before it's actually full, leaves an untouched 1 inch border around everything and there's no attachment to get into those spots, too expensive for the performance you get

   We have owned this product for less than a year and the vacuum cleaner is having some serious tech issues. It says there is a clog and so it turns on and after a few seconds it turns off again. I followed the instruction manual and cleaned everything and then let it dry for 24 hours. It still doesn’t work. It just turns on then off again. No YouTube videos help fix the issues. Whatever you do, do not buy this product.

    Godsend!

  I have POTS... its an autonomic nervous system disorder. Cleaning is physically challenging to say the least. I chose this vacuum because it's lighter than its competitors, has an ergonomic handle and long battery life. Having to sweep/vacuum and then mop... I can't physically do both so this machine is a godsend! While I was still dead and in pain after using this, at least I was less dead than traditional methods, and my house was fully clean. I can't grip a broom or vacuum after a few minutes so the loop handle on this machine made it possible to push and pull it without having to grip it with my hands. The self cleaning is amazing. I used to have a wet vac and hair in the bush was impossible to remove. This clumps it all together. I have long hair, two dogs, a cat, and now a foster dog and there is a LOT of hair! I'm finally able to walk barefoot in my house. I tried to use over small rugs and it kind of works, but the brush isn't designed for carpet. It can leave hairballs on the rug. One thing I learned is to clean out the dirty water tank and let it dry. The hepa filter got moldy pretty quickly. I went through 3 tanks cleaning 4 rooms and a bathroom. It is so quick to empty and refill that I found no issue with that. When I first used it, it was not picking up anything and I thought that it couldn't get into the tile grout... then I took the cardboard off the roller and it worked just fine... Lol.

  *Update 2*I still have not received my replacement and they have not contacted me back regarding this issue.*Update*It didn’t take but a couple months and my Tineco began having issues. I dealt with it for a while, but eventually contacted Tineco customer support and it has been a nightmare. I argued with them until they agreed to repair it and they sent it back with the exact same issues. I then contacted them again and had to argue with multiple agents over text message, because they won’t speak to you over the phone. They agreed to “repair” it again and I refused, so after days of fighting I was able to get them to replace the item. They have given me two days to drop it off at Fed-Ex and email them or else they will cancel my replacement. Horrible customer service. My items main body was broken, had start up issues, won’t charge or self clean properly and leaves dirty water all over my floors. It’s unfortunate, because I loved this item at first.I bought the Ifloor original, but returned it for this one and I am so glad I did! I love this thing, I haven’t swept or mopped in weeks. It cleans really well, I use it as a daily cleaner. I would recommend deep cleaning with a broom and mop every once in a while still. I don’t really have any complaints. It’s self propelled, discharges the clean water for you and the suction is great. It works on my tile, hard wood and laminate flooring throughout my house. Highly recommend this, it was a great investment for me.

  Prior to getting this masterpiece. I’ve been having to vacuum, steam mop and sweep the floors and they’ve never felt clean after all that work. I couldn’t ever wear white socks around the house because the floors still felt dirty.However now, my floors feel so nice!!!!  They don’t feel gritty anymore and my white socks stay relatively white when I walk around.  I have wood laminate and also floating wood flooring. This mop is freaking amazing.  It’s so quick and easy to do.  I got the floor one s3 and I’m able to do all my floors in my house (about 1750 sq ft) with about 20%battery left.The first couple of uses I did have to empty the dirty water tank and do a couple of self cleans after a couple rooms. However as your floors are maintained, you don’t have to do the self clean and empty the dirty water tank as much.  I think the first time I had to do stop and do the self clean like 4 or 5 times.  Now, I can get by with just emptying the dirty water tank once and save the self clean when I’m all done with the whole house.It does leave about an inch from the baseboards but I’m ok with that.  The cleaning after you’re done is quick and easy to do.  The roller you just have to take out and let air dry as the machine self cleans that.  Then just empty and rinse out the clean and dirty water tanks and wipe the bottom with a paper towel and you are done.I love this machine.  I don’t use the app as I don’t see a need to. Highly recommend this time saving machine!!!!  I can’t wait to mop my floors again. In fact I think I’ll mop right now.

    An updated review for higher elevation/altitude
  
","









  
  
    
  My daughter gifted this to me, and I am in awe!!!I have a lot of hardwood flooring that I would clean on my hand and knees....scrubbing by hand.  It took forever, and by the time I finished I was worn out.  Sore from kneeling and wringing out the rag etc.  I would clean twice a month. Using this was soooo much more efficient.  I was truly shocked at how dirty the water was with my first time using this.  I felt like my floors were pretty spotless. (We don’t wear shoes indoor etc). I could also not believe how much drier they were left....cleaner feeling and also cleaner looking.  It gets very close to the edge to clean as well.The self cleaning feature is a breeze to use.  I do leave the clean containers out to dry completely before I reassemble.I have talked this machine up so much that 5 people have ordered one, and I myself,  purchased a second one for our cabin.  I am hoping they will love their ifloor 3 as much as I do mine!I am now doing my floors weekly and just love the results.This is an update on my unit….I still LOVE this so much.  I had purchased a second one for a summer home that is situated at an elevation of 10,000. We live at the elevation of 5280 and have no problem with using the unit here .  However, not the case at the higher elevation.  It would run for approximately 10 seconds, then would shut off and the DWT (dirty water tank) would be lit to empty it.  Of course there was nothing in it, as it had only run for 10 seconds….press the start button and another 10 seconds etc. I tried everything I could think of…did I have the filter in correctly , was it fully charged etc.  I brought it back home to lower elevation and works perfectly.  Took it back up thinking that it may have been a fluke.  Same thing happens.  Bring it back home again and works well.  I then contact tineco….they told me to do a reset by doing this:I took it off the charger, with no lights on top lit up (battery bar etc). They said to remove the DWT and press and hold the self cleaning button for a total of 20 seconds.  By golly!  It worked!  My floors are finally clean.I put it on the charging base overnight and tried it out the next day….all is well. No problems!  So if you experience anything like this, give the above suggestions a try.  They have such wonderful and prompt customer service.  I’m still telling people how much I love this and they are buying them and love it too!FYI….I brought up my second unit to see if it would behave the same way up there.  It did exactly the same thing….ran for 10 seconds then shut off with DWT lit.  When I went to put it in the charging base to self clean the roller and spin it dry etc before bringing it back home, it would not do the self clean, shutting off every 10 seconds.  I had to do the reset first.

  Good: my hardwood floors throughout our home look better than ever! They never looked really clean. They are a darker color so dust shows a lot and we have hardwood in the kitchen, so there are many spills. The Tineco does a good job of cleaning the dried spills, grease splatters from the stove and anything else that spills. Might have to go over several time in tough, dried on spots, or hold in place. So much easier than scrubbing and cleans much better. The battery lasts at least 30-40 minutes. The unit is easy to clean. The liquid cleaner has a slight scent that disappears when dry. It works really well at cleaning and is economical. You use very little per tank refill. The S3 is quieter than my vacuum, but I can't use it if others are sleeping upstairs. It manuvers well. Huge improvement in the look and cleanliness of my floors. I keep it handy, charged, and filled and can use it easily for small areas or large.Two things not so good: it doesn't clean well around the edges in the front and along the left side of the unit. It won't pick up a thin line of crumbs that's sometimes in front of my stove. (I just follow up with a quick sponge in that spot to get what was missed) Second, it's profile is a little high. It doesn't go go very far under my dining and kitchen chairs or the china cabinet. I have to move all the chairs to clean.That said, it cleans my floors better than anything I've tried. The dirt is gone, not just pushed around. The floors are finally clean. They look beautiful and it's so easy to use. Overall, I love it!

    Has some design flaws....meh
  
","









  
  
    
  I waited excitedly for my vacuum to arrive. When it did I noted how heavy it was especially with the water tank on full.Here’s some flaws that other reviewers don’t mention for whatever reason:-in order to spray the water onto the floor you have to push down the spray button. Ok this seems simple enough right? I mean most devices have a button. But on this unit it’s on the back of the handle. When you place your hand on the handle, where your palm lies is where the spray button is. It was SO awkward trying to spray and vacuum at the same time. I am actually surprised no one has mentioned this.-secondly, this is pointless for corners. I ordered this to get rid of having to mop but now I still have to mop corners after using this. Instead I just purchased another swifter wet jet because at least that gets corners and has been trusty enough to work for years.-thirdly, battery life. Doesn’t last that long. They mention this so it’s not a surprise. But if you have a big area then you cannot get it all in one go. You have to keep coming back to charge.All in all the suction seemed to be very strong. I imagine with time it will weaken which is common with these wet/dry mops. I just felt like if I’m going to spend $300 on something at the very least it should be designed properly and comfortable to use.

  Pros: super lightweight, quiet, cleans the floors spotless. Cleaned up a disgusting, dried pile of something one of my animals hacked up and left hidden for me behind a door with it today. It took a few passes, but I did not have to touch the nasty mess with my hands! The cleaning solution only requires a tiny capful and leaves the rooms smelling fresh and clean.I don't think the battery life is any worse than my Dyson.Cons: self clean doesn't quite get ALL of my Rottweiler’s hair out of the roller and the self clean mode is a little noisy. Clean water tank is kinda small and, of course, they recommend using ONLY their brand of cleaning solution.Would definitely recommend!

  This product is a game changer. I am mixed on how much I actually like it vs how much I want to like it.Pro’s: vacuum and mop at the same time, which can be a time saver! It vacuums well and by the look of the dirty water, cleans well. No streaking on my floors and they feel clean!Cons: no scrubber so if something is stuck on the floor, you’ll need to scrape it off first. I also can’t believe how frequent I’m getting the alert to do a self-cleaning. I know I have a puppy and a cat, but I do sweep and mop regularly. Sometimes I am not even finishing my kitchen floor before the light flashes. Maybe I got a bad one? Also don’t expect it to clean the grout between your tiles. And it leaves about a 1-2 inch gap near the walls that are impossible to get with this machine.Overall, it is great for a quick vacuum and mopping. But I don’t think it’s worth the price that it sells for. It’s great for busy folks who are in “survival mode”. Like me, working full-time and in nursing school. Or moms with little ones who want to enjoy their time with their babies and not spend all their time cleaning floors.With that said, Moms: your cleaning can wait, don’t stress over a messy house. Your babies will grow up fast and once they’re grown, you can’t get that time back. Snuggle them, play with them. You can clean when they’re older. <3

  I am in LOVE with my Tineco vacuum mop! I have a toddler, two dogs, and a cat. Need I say more? This thing rocks. I am able to sweep and mop my floor at the same time! It can clean up big messes but I basically use it to maintain a blissfully clean floor. I mean is there any better feeling than walking barefoot on your hardwood floors knowing they are spotless?I can clean about a 2000 square-foot area on one charge. A little bit less if there are some big messes involved. What I love most is that it automatically detects areas on your floor that need more attention than others! There is also an auto button you can press yourself if you feel like you want a little extra power. I’m embarrassed to post what my dirty water tank looks like after a clean but I can tell you this thing is SO worth the money! I use mine about three times a week to keep my floors sparkling clean.*bonus* they include cleaning solution inside the box and all you need is one capful in your clean water tank and you’re ready to go. I like the scent too.  It smells light and clean and definitely not overpowering.

  I recently got a new to me condo that has tile or hardwood on the entire first floor.  Knowing I wanted a machine to help me clean I got this.  Yes it is a little pricey but I am very pleased with the cleaning and ease of use.  It cleans well, is easy to clean after cleaning and provides spare filter and roller.The down side.  It does not do edge cleaning.  You will have to clean about 2 inches to the baseboards all around the room.  It needs to have about 16% of the battery left to self clean.  I also recommend you empty the dirty water tank and ensure it has at least 1/2 a clean tank of solution before you self clean.  I always run the machines self clean twice.  No one wants a smelly roller.Other than that I highly recommend this to anyone worried about having excess water left on the floor.  It is easy to use, does a good job, cleans about 1800 sq feet with battery to spare, does NOT leave excessive water on the floor, it easy to clean and hopefully lasts years.

   So this was a purchase I skeptical in purchasing. I really didn’t think it would work so well. I was trying to choose between the Bissell or the Tineco. I currently own an older version of the Bissell and my floors always have a film and are still dirty. Like I clean them and if I do a wipe it still has a brown tinge to the paper towel. I used the Tineco and did a wipe test and nothing. I used a dry and a wet paper towel for the test and I was blown away. I also want to preface that this is even more amazing in my home because I have three dogs, a cat and a toddler in my house. I am constantly cleaning. I love too that it’s almost like a self propelled lawn mower it pulls itself forward so maneuvering is really easy. It doesn’t leave much of any water around. Picks up most of the fur. The self cleaning works really well. My only down fall on the product would be it doesn’t get right up against the baseboards but I haven’t really found a vacuum that does with out a tool.

    Incredible hard floor cleaning
  
","









  
  
    
  With a cat, dog, and three kids we needed a better floor cleaning system than a cordless stick vacuum.  The S3 is beyond what I thought could be accomplished with a mop/vac.  It truly cleans the floors and does it with ease.  The S3 is well built, powerful, sturdy, and intelligent.  It auto senses dirtier spots and turns up the cleaning power.  My floors have never been cleaner.Before filling it up,  take a few minutes to understand how to take it apart and put it together.  That way you don't have anxiety when you have a tub of dirty water and the S3 is telling you to clean its dirt chute.  For people with long hair animals (mine is great pyrenees--he's a giant furball)  take time after every cleaning to pull up the roller and clean the chute behind it where fur collects.  Things like large pieces candy wrappers will also get stuck in this area.  It is easily cleaned out using your fingers.  I have only had one complete clog where I sectioned up a large clump of fur and it was too much fur at once for the machine to suction.  The S3 stopped and said it needed cleaning.The S3 comes with cleaning solution.  A tiny capful is all thats needed per fill up.  The floors look great!  I was hesitant to buy due to never owning a combination vac/mop and the $400 price point.  I do own an older model Tineco stick vac that still works great, so I know the company makes reliable products.If you can afford to buy the S3 I strongly recommend it.  Its such a huge improvement from regular vacuuming and the floors look much better.

They have live people on the phone ""on occasion"".  At times you get a recording.  You send an email and if you are lucky, you will get a response in 24 to 48 hours but sometimes it is a week or two.  These machines are GREAT.  Until they break!  And break they will.  It really is a shame as there is not another mop/vacuum combo that is as good as these machines but they are not made to last and when they break you have to struggle to get them repaired or replaced.  So far I sent mine in for repair.  It was sent back not repaired, in fact worse then when I sent it in.  Then I spent weeks trying to get hold of them (the whole process took 5 weeks!!) and they finally agreed to send me another machine.  Well that machine is broken.  It left big puddles all over my floors.  So now they are not talking to me again.  They sent one email to say, gee, sorry, what can we do?  I said send me a working machine and then they went silent.  I will be filing a complaint with the BBB and the Attorney general on their business practices (or lack there of).  BTY, they have an F rating with the BBB.  Their warranty is useless since they cannot fix a machine that does not work and if you have a replacement sent it may not work either.  BTY, also, the batteries after a year will be only giving you about half the life that you had when you purchased it.  So even if you machine does not break down, your battery will require you to charge it up more and more.  I would wait to purchase a machine from a company that stands behind their products.

  Another update: I changed the stars to 4 stars because I love my machine.  After it was replaced I will continue to rave about this product!Update: I have a new machine! Yay! I love this machine and have recommended it to everyone I know. After a few months of back and forth they did replace my machine and I have a new one. My sister has the same machine and hers has not broke or needed any replacement parts. So it was probably just my machine. So if you’re thinking of purchasing a Tineco don’t hesitate. You won’t be sorry.I ordered this in August 2021. It no longer charges. I’ve been in communication with Tineco and they have since ghosted me. I loved this machine until it stopped charging. When I reached out to Tineco they seemed like they would help me, unfortunately they haven’t responded to any of my emails answering all of their questions. It’s very frustrating to have a company not stand behind their product. I have recommended this machine to everyone I know. I will now tell them to not spend the money for if it breaks the company will not help you.

  Update: I have recently changed my star rating to a 4. Once Tineco had contacted me via email they were very helpful. We live in a time where we want and need assistance now. But some companies still go via email. It took a little longer than I would’ve liked to get my product back but I have finally received it and it seems to be in working order. They have been more than accommodating.They have assured me that they will be changing their customer service options in the future and I hope this is true. This product has a very good potential of being great!Well I’ve had this since March 22 and I’ve absolutely loved it until today I went to clean my floors and it just spilled water all over the place. I have taken it apart I have cleaned it it has a fully charged battery there’s water in it I emptied the dirty water I have clean the brush and nothing is working I tried to contact customer service and they don’t answer. I don’t understand how you could sell $300-$400 products and not have a support to contact 24 hours or even during normal business hours. This is absolutely ridiculous and now I have to go buy a bucket and a mop and do with the old way before I wasted $350 on this thing.

  Let me start by saying this vacuum is amazing when you first get it. It cleans really well and is super convenient for having kids and hardwood floors. I was blown away by how dirty my floors were and loved my vacuum so much that I talked my friends into getting them.That being said…I am on my 3rd vacuum since October 2020. We follow all manufacturers instructions for cleaning and maintenance and the vacuum has still died on us twice. The company stands by their warranty but the process for a replacement is not a smooth one. You will be asked to send multiple videos and then you will have to ship it back to them. They will not send a replacement back until they receive your broken one which will leave you without a vacuum for an extended period of time. All in all our last submission for a replacement took 3 weeks. You will not receive a new vacuum either, they are refurbished. I am honestly just riding out the warranty and will not be purchasing this brand again.PROS:Cleans wellEasy to useConvenientHolds decent chargeCONS:Motor doesn’t last longFrequent emptying of dirty waterFrequent refill of clean waterTedious, drawn out warranty process

  I rarely ever mopped my floors before buying this vacuum (maybe once every few months). Ever since I've had the Tineco Floor One S3, I cannot stand for my floors to have a spot on them! It cleans so thoroughly!! I didn't realize what I was missing out on until I got this vacuum. AND no more having to use a million paper towels or old towels to clean up messes made by my 2 children or my 2 large dogs! I just whip out this guy and it's clean in just a few minutes. It's so light and SUPER easy to maneuver - it feels like I'm vacuuming with a traditional lightweight non-bulky vacuum.  It powers up so quickly that I can use it for little spills or spots really quickly without any hassle. I LOVE the self-cleaning feature. I just put the vacuum on the charger and press the self-clean function and BOOM it cleans itself! I just have to empty the dirty water tank into the sink. Maintenance is super easy too! Run self-cleaning cycle, dump and rinse out the dirty water tank, refill clean water tank with water and a capful of the cleaning solution, and once a week I take out the roller brush and filter and deep clean them by hand. However, an extra roller brush and extra filter come with the vacuum so no waiting on the other ones to dry! Plus the storage base has places to hold the extra filter and roller brush so they can air dry and be easily stored in a convenient place! Oh and don't be scared off by the 30 min battery life or the size of the tanks. I can clean my entire kitchen/back hall/laundry room/guest bath (approx 1,000 sqft) on one battery charge and only 2-3 dirty water tank emptying or clean water tank refills. Which is about the same amount times I'd have to change mop water but this way I'm not having to lift a heavy bucket. Oh did I mention the ""smart"" feature?! It tells you if the floor is dirty! Then it speeds up or slows down depending on the amount of dirt and it tells you when it's cleaned! Amazing!!! I am truly in love with this vacmop! It is worth EVERY PENNY. Stop guessing if you should buy it and JUST BUY IT! You won't be sorry.

    Leaking and Broken Roller, STINKS - Less Than A Year Old
  
","









  
  
    
  The roller no longer snaps in properly and now it will suck up larger things more easily which then clog the machine. It leaks water everywhere while in use. I have been fairly good about cleaning it out after each use, occasionally I won't clean it right away because i only used it for a quick spill clean up and I will be cleaning my floors later in the day. It stinks permanently now, I have even tried using lysol to wash the roller and parts but it still smells like musty water. The cleaner it comes with is okay, it smells nice but it doesn't deep clean. Also using anything except the tineco cleaner voids the warranty which is BS because like I said the machine stinks after only using the tineco cleaner because it is not strong enough.TL:DR Not worth $300, MAYBE worth $150

    BUYER BEWARE OF SPECIAL DEALS

  BEWARE: We bought this vacuum from a lightning deal on prime day for a good price. We thought the product would be new because it didn’t indicate anywhere we were buying a used product. When the package arrived, we opened it and notice it was obviously used. The vacuum itself was filthy with smudges, watermarks, hairs, & dirt. ALSO the cleaning solution bottle was placed inside a ziploc bag and was open!!!! We were unable to get the vacuum replaced (probably due to the lightning deal) so sadly, we just had to opt for the refund. Highly disappointing!!!

  The device comes with a recharging stand/dock that sits on the floor. Ours is always in our kitchen. We have a one-year-old who loves to throw food a bit too much...After sweeping large jumps, this vacuum is great for getting up the sticky grease, grime, and leftoversThe device has two tanks. One for clean water (with some cleaning solution) and another tank where the dirty water filters out to. It is kinda gross to see how dirty the second tank becomes.  Cleaning the second tank is easy, just pull it off and pour it down the drain (with your drainer in place still). The drainer will catch large bits that should not go down the sink.This device is great and does way more than a swifter would. You really get a deep clean and can see the results in the lower tank.Good for a Dad who does not like cleaning.

    For Lite use only
  
","









  
  
    
  This is for a home with Lite traffic and 1 to 2 short haired animals. I am a floor fanatic. I obsess over if my floors are actually clean. So I've had all the gadgets. I was super excited for this one. I've had it since Feb and at first I was impressed, but now seeing long term results not so much.First I'd like to point out if you have multiple long hair animals this is not the unit for you. I can vacuum my floors one day, and the next I have clumps of dog hair in the corners. This unit will clog if there are clumps of hair.After a few months I noticed there was a dirt ring about an inch away from my base boards. This unit does not clean to the ends of your floor. It stops about an inch from your baseboards. So you end up having to go over that area with something else.If your home is prone to mud being tracked in this unit is only good if you clean it as soon as it happens or your going to be going over and over and over it on high if it dries.Same goes for the kitchen. If something falls on the floor and you leave it there until the end of the night. It does not come up easily, and if it's sticky you can FORGET IT.I find myself going back to my steam mop if my floors are super dirty. (Usually 3 days of not being mopped) because the tineco just doesn't seem to be able to lift up set in debris. Just fresh just happened debris.The self cleaning cycle is pointless. You have to empty out the debris chamber and wash the roller and chamber by hand after every use or it will start stinking FOREVER. So you can do the self cleaning cycle but right after you have to take it apart and clean it anyways so I really don't understand that concept at all.It is amazing for lite use. So If you don't have multiple kids or animals I would definitely recommend it. If you do I'd probably save the money and get a swiffer or steam mop.

    Great for basic cleaning and cleanup of spills
  
","









  
  
    
  With multiple kids, we were looking for something to make frequent after-meal cleanup easier. Crumbs, peas, pizza, etc are always falling from plates. We have a cordless vacuum and that helps, but isn't good for debris that isn't completely dry, like the peas and pizza. So we end up having to wipe up most of it with napkins before we can vacuum and we have to vacuum multiple times each day. Our entire first floor is bamboo and our bathroom is penny tile, so we need to keep the mess under control or the kids spread it quickly.We bought a Karcher FC25 from Costco because it was supposedly able to handle cleanup without having to pre-vacuum, but it just kicked everything around, so we still had to clean up manually and then use the Karcher to mop.My sister showed this Tineco to us when we visited her house, then I found it on sale a few weeks later and decided to try it. After a month of use almost daily, I really like it. It is must more convenient to use than the Karcher since there is no cord. Actual use is similar to the Karcher - the microfiber drum spins and picks up debris and the vac sucks it into the dirty tank. Comparing the two units, the Tineco doesn't kick stuff around at all and it handles spills better. Just today I grabbed it to clean up a yogurt spill. The Karcher seems to get the floors cleaner while leaving them drier.  With the Tineco, I have to go over the same spots over and over, or slowly, occasionally. The Karcher needed the same with certain messes, but not as often.Both devices have obnoxious clean water tanks with a small hole for the water that is not in a corner or edge so it is nearly impossible to get all the water out of them when finished.Both devices have pretty simple, 2 piece dirty water tanks, but the Karcher is is easier to rinse. The Tineco has a small, hard-plastic prefilter of sorts that either needs to be removed when rinsing or I have to pick the debris off.The stand for the Tineco is nicer since it has storage built it. Charging is easy since the vacuum rests in the stand and automatically starts charging. The battery is plenty for me to do our kitchen, eating area, hall, bathroom and more small spaces with battery remaining, maybe 700 ish square feet.Other thoughts:Handle is comfortable.Automatic roller rinsing is convenient and works well.Takes a while to charge but not slowly enough to be a problem.Edge cleaning is a disappointment. Since the roller is encased, the roller can't get as close to anything. For that reason, the Karcher makes it much easier to clean all the way to the baseboards and under the toekicks in the kitchen.I expected the suction to not be strong enough since some cordless dry vacuums have more power. However, it seems that the wet roller is very effective in picking up debris and the suction is plenty to clean the roller, so I am pleased.Overall, it was worth the money and I like using it. It is convenient, cleans rather well and is pretty easy to fill and clean.

    Best Purchase For House With Young Children or Pets
  
","









  
  
    
  Ok folks, I am not going to say anything that the other people have not already said, but this this is a must if you have a young child learning how to eat...  We have a cordless vacuum that we love as well, but when you get peas on the floor or bananas that mush right into the floor instead of being vacuumed up this thing will save your life!  Now we literally wipe all the food on the high chair onto the floor while cleaning it.  Then get this thing out and go to town.  It picks up everything, while mopping the floor at the same time!Like some others have said, I think my wife loves this thing more than me.  It really is that good at doing what it is supposed to.  My one complaint is that the battery could last a bit longer for folks that have hard surfaces through out their whole house.  We can get though all of our house, but the battery starts to drop before we are done completely.  Plus is that the base charges the unit rather quickly so it is always ready to go when we need it!We caught ours on sale a while back and after using it I would say do not even wait for a sale, just get it.  You will not regret it at all!  Of course if there is a sale then certainly go for it because that is just that much better!  100% will buy one of these again should this one need replacing!

   We have used the Bissell cross wave for a few years and loved it. Super timer saver. Used it daily. But it was time for a new one.We wanted a cordless wet dry vac and this one was a good price and seemed a good fit.The unboxing was worrisome. The liquid soap that comes with it spilled in the box so it took a bit of wiping down. Not the best way to start a new product.But the vacuum itself is nice. Love the cordless. It propels it self forwards which helps make vacuuming easier. Love the self clean feature. Just one button push. Self clean in Bissell was more of a chore than it needed it to be.I wish we could control the water coming out like the Bissell. Maybe I just need to get used to it but would be nice to stop water coming at times. Right now it just flows cactus Bissell that let water out when we pushed a little button.The clean water container seems small to me. Also the hole is not at very top so hard to get 100% water out. Over time I worry of junk building up there.The dirty water container is as expected. Kind of hard to explain but they have this little tray thing which helps to stop stuff reaching the air filter. In the Bissell we always clean the filter mesh since it didn’t have the little tray to prevent stuff from getting to it.It’s pretty light. Heavier than it looks though but not bad.So far so good. Just a few minor things here....oh and we love the cordless ability :)

They were out of stock for a long time and now have simply been removed from the Tineco Store page.  If you go to that page, almost everything is out of stock.It seems like Tineco is closing up shop and moving on.  I would strongly consider this before making any purchase.

  This product is wonderful for small areas but when trying to clean your whole house you have to empty the dirty water tank and fill the clean water tank WAY to often. I have a 1,000 square foot house and I’ve had to empty and refill 4 times already and run 4 self cleaning cycles. It’s a pain to have to stop in the middle of a room to keep refilling. I would suggest the bissel crosswave pet pro because it has bigger tanks

  So far so good. I did have some problems with air in the lines when I first starting using the machine. After some google searching I found out how to fix it.Love how it can clean itself but it seems to want to do a self cleaning after very little of actual floor cleaning.  Also the tray never gets clean when it’s running the self clean cycle so the dirty water just pools some.Overall it cleans the floors very well and I have totally replaced my everyday mopping.

  I was a little skeptical at first. But honestly, I have 2 toddlers and they make such messes every single day. The fact that this machine can handle cleaning wet and dry messes at the same time = A+ Product.I will say, the dirty water reservoir does fill up pretty quickly & when it does, the machine stops. My floors were dirtier than I expected, I stopped 3 times during my cleaning to empty out the dirty water reservoir. Other than that, my floors feel AMAZING! Way better than I thought they would. Blew my expectations out of the water. The self cleaning is a huge plus, I thought I got the thing clean but after running the self cleaning mode there was more gunk that was pushed through. I look forward to using this every day after my boys get done making their usual messes!

  Saw good and bad reviews. I absolutely love this product. It is a bit pricey though.  It is so great for a quick clean up. I hate sweeping then moping. This takes care of that in one step and saves so much time.  It’s not perfect though. There are certain spot like under cabinets and along edges that it can’t get as well so I still have to use a broom and mop occasionally but I am still in love with this product. It cuts the floor cleaning  in half

    Great cleaning but cumbersome
  
","









  
  
    
  This vacuum is impressive and surely gets the floor clean after multiple rounds (and before I used it for the first time, I had just swept & mopped with a swifter wet jet). It is however pretty cumbersome. Everytime you use it you must empty the dirty water tank (expected), clean it & the roller out & dry, refill the clean water tank with cleaning solution, use the “self clean” option, and then after it done... take it all apart again, clean, and refill the clean water tank to start cleaning the floor again. It’s a lot to do when the majority of your house is hard floors. I bought this to clean my floors better AND to save time. So far, it’s not saving me time but it is cleaning the floors better.

  This vacuum is exactly what I wanted for my hardwoods and tile. It does a thorough job and notifies me when the roller needs to be cleaned. This is easily and automatically done wo removing the roller. Then one continues cleaning. The only downside is the batteries last about 1/2 hr. at which time it is set in the base for recharging. If that is enough time for your home then I highly recommend it.

  I love my ifloor! We recently remodeled and I have a LOT of vinyl plank flooring. I have 3 kids and Golden retrievers in my house and this thing saves my sanity with keeping the floors clean.  It does great with the dog hair also, I will say though if my dogs are shedding a lot I vacuum first so I don’t have to stop and clean out the ifloor so much. But for daily use I typically don’t have to vacuum first. Only during heavy shedding or if I haven’t vacuumed in few days.

Other than that, always clean all parts when you're done. Do not leave water especially the dirty water sit, it will make the unit and microfiber roller smell!

  I have 8 kids, I mop about 2-3 times a day, before I was using a steam mop, which was great but this tineco seems easier to keep clean, it picks up amazing. I don't necessarily need to sweep before i mop, i will occasionally if there are big pieces on the ground that i don't want to clog and mess this tineco up. When i would use the steam mop the pads would get so nasty, even washing them to reuse they got dirty so quickly and i would have to wait until i wash/dry the pad to reuse it. The tineco in the other hand I can clean majority of the rooms and still keep going it's that easy, I just have to clean the water tank, and sometimes the debris part but its good to go after a couple self cleaning modes and cleaning the water tank still takes way much lesser time to do.

  We have pretty high traffic in my house as well as a dog. This vacuum has been a life saver and keep my floors clean.

However it has great suction power as it has picked up bb’s and screws that got stuck under my dining room table.

  It’s a bit pricey, but It’s perfect for what I needed. Use it for vinyl floor and it works best on that surface. I use it on tile floor too but it only cleans the surface. Grout cleaning is another procedure. Dry time is quick as it doesn’t lay down a ton of water. Self cleaning feature is cool. Pretty quiet, not like other cleaners I have had. The Hoover floor mate was really loud. This is much quieter.

  So I started out super impressed by this little vacuum , only to end up urgently sending it back right before my 30 day cut off.Unless you want to spend as much time cleaning it out as it takes to poorly vacuum and mop this vacuum isn’t for you. It doesn’t come with a hose attachment, so right there it can’t replace your regular vacuum.Every time you vacuum you’re have to clean and dry the entire insides of the vacuum including the cloth tightly wrapped around plastic roller that is impossible to dry over a 24 hr period, so if you’re like me and want to clean daily you’ll end up with a mildew smelling roller, rolling gross water all over your house.Also hair from my one short haired cat clogged it more than once…Disappointed

I saw the crosswave awhile back and my plan was to get it eventually, but TikTok creators showing comparisons of this brand vs it’s competitor quickly made me look into Tineco! I mean WOW. My house is very old and has the original flooring so until we move or decide to renovate I don’t expect the floors to ever be perfectly clean and bringing up clear water but to say I am baffled seeing what each room brings up is an understatement. I can guarantee I’ll be using this bad boy every day. The floors take almost no time to dry afterward and the self cleaning is completely mesmerizing. Dreams really can come true. 😍

  Pros:-“walks” forward by itself, therefore you won’t be killing your back too much.-the fact that removes dust and mops at the same time is objectively amazing-the self cleaning mode is not bullcrap as I thought it would be, but ACTUALLY cleans the brush.-the charging dock is veeery convenient and has holders for accessories and to place the brush to let air dry.-floors are cleaned but since they’re not smooth but rather on the rougher side, many spots could use deeper cleaning-the floor dries up super fast because not an insane amount of water is used-if you have smooth tile I highly recommendCons:-The brush is so ‘dull’ that it doesn’t work magnificently on hardwood floors (sealed 12x24 ceramic tile with rougher surface mimicking wood)-The machine demands to be placed on the dock for self-cleaning approximately every 30 sq ft (waste of time)-When on the dock for self-cleaning, the battery is not charging so the function is actually draining your battery autonomy that is already quite limited to 18 minutes (in max mode) or 25 in eco mode.-if you have long hair around your house (I shed like a German Shepard) you better use your broom/vacuum to collect them first, otherwise it’s going to be a MESS to remove them from the dirty water tank.-the repeated cleaning of the parts (tank) while trying to clean the house it’s quite a pain the back-forget about cleaning corners or getting close to the baseboards

  Update: Tineco responded but never resolved my issue with the foul odor. I’ve used my machine twice and although it cleans well, that stinch is too awful for me to stand in my house. I’m going to shop for something else.This machine works well. Don’t get me wrong. It gets the job done. However, I’ve only used one time because the tank that holds the dirty water smells like stagnant foul fish water and Ive cleaned that thing so many times. It’s something to do with the plastic absorbing that dirty water and not coming out. I’ve contacted Tineco and nothing. The said I probably left the dirty water in in overnight. I told them no because I had to clean it several times to do my entire house. It was so gross. Your house will look clean but will smell like a wet dog and we have no pets in the house.

    1st time use

  Update: Had it now over six months. I ended up vacuuming my floors before I use it ( to save on liquid cleaner and time since it wants to keep doing a self clean CONSTANTLY. I spend way more time waiting for it to self clean and filling up the clean fluid container and emptying the dirty container, even with me pre vacuuming, than actually cleaning my floors. The only good feature is the battery holds but can't say that is a good thing since it spends more time charging while self cleaning in the hub, than cleaning. My friend owns a bissel and I think I'll get that instead. If you have a tiny floor maybe. But then again a mop is faster. Don't spend the money. It's a waste. I regret it.This is my second one. The 1st one showed full battery but never turned on no matter what. This one works. After 1 use:Pros: Dry quick. Loved the fact that I didn't need to vacuum before (my main reason for getting it as I don't mind vacuum or mop but less time by cutting out one is good.) It didn't kick the dirt around. Vacuum edges decent. Had to go over areas a few times to clean certain spots that I know my Monado would've taken off immediately. It did do a good job at cleaning but takes a bit longer than mopping,  granted I double clean my floors.Cons:I only cleaned my kitchen and entry way that has marble tile (cheap ones) and I had to refill the clean canister 3 times and empty the dirty one 3 times and and it went in to self clean 3 times. Its about160 sq  feet max.  My floors were not that dirty. I still have to clean the machine, I did empty the dirty container and washed it out real well but not the brush roller yet.Even with refilling and emptying the canisters I feel it still saved some time. The canister cleaned out easier than a bucket and the floors dried easy. I will still need to do deep clean once a month or less.Is it worth the price. Mmm. Will c in the next month. Will try it on my basement laminate wood look floors. Will then update stars.Ia it worth the

    Better than my Bissell Crosswave (Corded Model)
  
","









  
  
    
  Love this Floor cleaner! I have a Bissell Crosswave corded and wanted a cordless mop vac. I was going to get the newer Bissell Crosswave cordless and after a lot of research and a good Prime Day sale, I bought the Tineco. I’ve used it only a couple times so far and have no buyers remorse.So comparisons. My corded Bissell Crosswave is extremely loud, I mean twice as loud as a standard vacuum. Yes, the cordless Bissell is much quieter, but I feel you can barely here this Tineco.My Bissell would squirt unevenly and often leave streaks. So far, the Tineco is a nice even coverage with no streaking.Weight difference - hands down the Tineco is lighter. I mean significantly lighter. Surprisingly it being battery operated you’d think it’d be heavier, not the case here. For elderly or weaker individuals, I’d definitely go with the Tineco.Cleaning the machines are both similar.I do like how the Tineco one operates better than the Bissell Crosswave. The Bissell operates like a steam cleaner. You have to push the spray button and release when you just want it to suck. The Tineco does it all on its own. Also I like when you sit it up to stop, it auto shuts off. Then starts automatically when you go to vacuum again.

    Floor cleaning is much easier and better with this machine. My dark tile floors look great now!
  
","









  
  
    
  I have dark ceramic tile thru my whole house and several pets. Before the Tineco machine, I struggled every day trying to get the tile looking clean. i used different mops and even a steam cleaner, but the dark tile looked dusty and hazy all the time. I swept or vacuumed first, but it did not help. Now, I just run the Tineco machine over the tile once and the dark brown color is shining, with no dust or haze. I don't even sweep up birdseed and dog hair before running the machine! With just one pass, the floor is perfect! The water i pour out of the machine at the end looks like mud! Very satisfying. The floor dries very quickly after, almost no waiting to walk on it. Plus, the machine is self-propelled, so I am using much less effort. Cleaning the floor is easy and gratifying now. At first, I had a problem with the battery running out before I finished all my floors (whole house is tiled), but then I read the instruction that said the battery will last longer if you run the machine on ""regular"" (one light bar), not ""max"" (two light bars) power. I tried this and was able to clean my whole house without recharging. I had extra power left after cleaning the whole house, so I could have used the ""max"" power part of the time, but I didn't need it.  The floor is wonderfully clean now and with a LOT less time and effort than it took to sweep and mop ""the old way"". I love this machine! If it keeps on running like this, I will be totally satisfied!

  You know how mopping never seems worth it because you know that after a few passes on one area you're basically just redistributing wet dirt around your floors, so you almost never mop? Since getting this, my floors are literally perfect all the time. I can get my ~1000 square feet of floor from a 9 to a 10 in about 15 minutes including emptying the tank and running a self-clean. The self clean function really works, you get to like 98% clear water and the cloth of the brush roller never develops a scent (take it out and let it stand upright to dry fully to keep it even fresher). It's thrilling to see the dark water come out of the dirty water tank. It's faster, physically easier, and degrees more effective than mopping, so you actually feel motivated to use it, and frequently. Equally effective on wood and tile. I vacuum beforehand because I'm a clean freak, but it also does pick up large particles (hair, food crumbs, etc), so in a pinch, you can use it in lieu of a dry vacuum and get your vacuuming and mopping down in one pass. Long story short, I will never live without one of these again.I own both this model and the black one with the led screen and the robot voice and the stupid internet of things features (all basically useless upgrades). They're both amazing, but they both have the same essential cleaning features. The only difference that might matter is that the higher end model has a slightly larger battery which also seems to contribute to stronger self-propulsion, but even in my biggish two bedroom, the water chambers run out long before the battery ever would, I've never run it down to lower than 70% in one whole apartment cleaning.

  Left streaks all over my floor. I was able to complete about half the floor before it needed to be docked for brush cleaning - wasnt even halfway through water tank and the floors were professionally cleaned 2 days ago! (they weren't that dirty to start with!) Also hate that it doesn't completely dry the floor as advertised. The vacuum only pulled up water when you pushed it forward..well who mops without a forward and back motion?! I would have to mop the house in a continuous circle to get it to pull up the extra moisture. Not willing to compromise my wood floors being left wet.Also it's advertised as a mop AND vacuum..i mean, you aren't doing carpets with this thing..it's meant to vacuum and mop at the same time but has no functionality to ONLY vacuum. (And forget stairs. This thing is HEAVY and not meant to be used on stairs).Returning! Would rather use my steam mop and a cheap moosoo stick vacuum.

  When I first got this Tineco I thought it was a miracle. I overlooked some of the annoying things because it was doing a decent job on the main parts of my floors.It missed the edges and didn’t get up against the wall or baseboards but I could go back and wipe those clean. It leaves about a 2” unwashed edge along walls or furniture legs.It’s a PAIN to clean. You have to take the whole thing apart, and clean inside the dirty water bin and pull out the roller and wash it and clean the tray and lid and leave it open to air dry. And that’s after running the self cleaning cycle.The self cleaning cycle that seldom runs completely through without an issue. Generally I have to empty the bin or refill the clean water or find a clog before it will start the self clean cycle again. It’s time consuming and probably takes longer than just vacuuming and washing the floor another way.But here’s the kicker…. After several months of use it just stops working.And the company isn’t surprised.So save your money. Don’t buy one of these.

    Leaves streaks and horrible customer service

  I initially loved my tineco. After about 5 months of owning it, it started leaving streaks behind. I tried everything but nothing fixed the issue. After some procrastination I finally contacted Tineco and it was a pain in the rear. I was told to ship it. After shipping it I got it back in 2 days. I was very impressed with the time it took to get it back. Unfortunately, the problem was not fixed and it was missing the handle screws. I contacted Tineco right away and after countless emails I was always given some type of excuse, first to wait for my refund of the shipping, then they wanted videos and pictures, then they said they would replace it with a refurbished one which I did not want  because they obviously cant repair them. So they finally agreed to refund me but only a percentage even though the machine worked properly for 5 months only. Then they requested pictures and video again and now when I try to contact them I get no reply. I will not be purchasing Tineco again just because their customer service sucks!! Waste of my time and money!

  Product is great. Works good and cleans good. However 1 it dies really fast.  2 the power cord just stopped working 1 month of buying product. Thought it was only mine but my boss bought one and it happen to hers too. Then you contact customer support for warranty and they ask you  for videos and nonsense. Like how I am supposed to video a power cord not working. I try to just purchase a new cord from website and it's been out of stock For a while. Comes to show you how many power cords stop working. So now I have a $300 vacuum mop that's just sitting there. So I would say it was a waste of money. DON'T BUY.... unless u want it sitting there.

    High maintenance but works well
  
","









  
  
    
  I was really excited about the Tineco and it did not disappoint; however, I’m not thoroughly impressed with every aspect. One reason I went with the newer version was because I liked that it turned red until the mess was thoroughly cleaned up. I have found this feature cannot really be relied on. I went over a little dried kitty puke and it stayed blue. It turned red in areas that already looked clean. My Husband thought it might be reacting off shadows or something. There was a high traffic area it turned red on and I was pleased with that but it’s definitely not accurate.The fact that it propels itself forward was exciting to me, it could practically run itself, just needed a little direction. Well it’s not such a fun feature when you’re pulling it back to go over areas. It gets exhausting quick, kind of reminiscent of chasing my toddler.My last gripe is that it is extremely high maintenance. A mop bucket is basically two steps for maintenance: fill up the bucket with solution and water, empty the bucket and run the mop under the sink. Done. The Tineco needs to be changed twice while doing my living area, then it needs to be changed once for its self cleaning cycle. Then everything has to be washed out thoroughly and left to dry. I didn’t know to take out the roller and after a day it smelt like mildew. So you’re thoroughly cleaning a disgusting tank, pulling out wet hairs, crumbs, etc then you are scrubbing the roller, filter, etc after every single use. My roller is currently outside because it didn’t dry over the sink overnight.All this aside, it did a killer job cleaning my floors. They are streak free and I felt excited to go over all the messes. I think I will get into a routine with it where all the things I find complicated I’ll find short cuts for.  I’ll update in a couple months to see if any of my thoughts have changed.

    Update:  Once again our machine died !  This is 2nd in 10 months.
  
","









  
  
    
  This is an ""out of the box"" review which I'll update in 6 months or so.  I've had literally a couple of dozen hard floor scrubbers over my years of breeding Cavaliers from inexpensive Hoover Floormates up to an $1100 Clark ""commercial"" model and quite frankly have found all to be lacking.  With that said, I'll review this product fresh out of the box and will adjust up or down on the rating as time goes by.THINGS I LIKE SO FAR:  Light weight, cordless, the self cleaning feature does a pretty good job of keeping machine clean and fresh, brush doesn't tangle with hair (HUGE for me with all the dog hair), Cleans relatively well and has a ""Max"" power mode for stubborn grime, much quieter than any other machine I've had to date, long enough run time to get me through the 650 sq ft that I routinely clean one to two times per day, very maneuverable and I can get in, around and under (low profile) all the toys and apparatus of puppyland and I can get under many of the areas I couldn't clean without moving in the adult dog area.THINGS I DON'T LIKE SO FAR:  My biggest complaint and the thing that really knocks a couple of stars off the rating is the size of the clean and dirty water tanks.  I have to constantly refill the clean water and empty the dirty water tanks throughout the aforementioned daily cleaning routine.  Both tanks should be 3X bigger.  It is very annoying to having to keep running back and forth to the tap to dump and refill tanks is a big issue, the fact that you have to use the mfg cleaning solution (not that it does a bad job, but I will constantly have to make certain I have a generous supply on hand as I have to order from Amazon and allow plenty of time for delivery), and although I like that it cleans itself, it will have you running back to either replenish the clean water tank or dump the dirty water tank after you are done cleaning, and the VOICE......UGH.....it jabbers all the time!  It never stops talking to you whether it is alerts to clean dirty water tank, fill clean water tank, start self clean, max mode, auto mode, replace appliance on charger (often when not needed), shutting off.  It is a total NAG!  Just give me an indicator light for those instances and stop TALKING!  Although this seems like a small complaint, it really is very annoying!So, that is my take on the new machine.  We'll see how well it performs over time.  I've found that most cleaners work well ""out of the box"" but don't stand up to daily use.  We'll see.  Updates to come.UPDATE:  First machine died after only a few months.  Now replacement machine is in it's death throes and is doing exactly the same thing as the first machine.  It will run for just a few seconds and then quit.  Not a very good track record for a machine that is only 10 months old!

  No other way to describe this. I have the iRoomba s9 (which I love) and the Tineco Pure One (I also love); but this is hands down the most amazing floor cleaner on the planet. I have a house full of white high gloss tiles and this is so easy to use and cleans amazingly well. It gets all the small dog hair that my iRoomba leaves behind. I know its a pretty hefty price tag but it has cut down on my cleaning time substantially. Don't hesitate if you're on the fence.

  We bought the Tineco one floor s3 in October 2020. Initially, it worked pretty good and did its job at its best. After 3 months the charging base wasn’t working properly so we had to put some support and keep the base crooked for it to continue charging. After 6 months the charging base completely stopped working. When we tried to contact the customer service through phone, all we can hear is a recorded response asking us to contact them through email and not phone because of the pandemic situation. So, I contacted them over the email response was they need photo and video proof and finally they themselves called us. When we tried to explain the situation, the lady on the other end was rude and asked us to send the whole product for them to check and repair it and send it back to us. She said she will send us the return label and we need to take the machine to FEdEx. Seriously, do we have that much time to wait for their product to be repaired and sent back us. Especially, when you need to clean your house everyday!!!! After spending $399 for a piece of junk from China we need to go through hell of a process to make it work again. Do you think it’s all worth it?? Please save your money and run away from this junk. Will never recommend it to anyone.

    Spectacular at cleaning your hard floors in a very short amount of time
  
","









  
  
    
  This TINECO Floor One S3 Cordless Hardwood Floor Cleaner is spectacular at cleaning your hard floors in a very short amount of time but if you have pets or people that shed a lot of hair, it's not quite as quick and easy. (Also note that this is for hard floors only. It is not for vacuuming carpeting or rugs.)So basically, this is a floor machine that vacuums and scrubs your hard floors simultaneously, sucking up the dirty water and leaving your floors super clean. The floors dry so quickly, I wondered if it was a steam cleaner, too, but it's not. It just vacuums up the dirty water so well that there is very little left on the floor. And wow, the water in the dirty water tank is filthy! It also has a stand that also serves as a charging dock. It has easily changeable brush rollers and filters. The dirty water tank is easy to remove and clean. There is even a self cleaning cycle that cleans the brush roller very well. Basically, you only clean manually the dirty water tank and the area where the brush roller is installed and the HEPA filter, which takes very little time.It's a quality, well built, machine but the manual leaves a bit to be desired for such an expensive machine. For example, it comes with an extra roller and HEPA filter, which I assumed were to be used when the installed ones wore out. The manual doesn't really make it clear. Also, there are two accessory holders but it doesn't say where they go. (They attach to the sides of the charging stand.)The machine speaks to you - giving you status reports on the charging status, telling you when to run the self cleaning cycle, when to refill the clean water tank, when to empty the dirty water tank, etc. This is actually pretty great. And it's extremely gratifying to see how dirty the water is after cleaning. Best of all, it's super quiet and maneuvers very well. I am currently living in an apartment with mostly hard flooring and I can use this machine at night without worries of disturbing any neighbors.I was upset at first when it told me to start the self cleaning cycle after only about 10 minutes of floor cleaning. And then, I saw that the HEPA filter must be fully dry before reinstalling it in the machine after rinsing it as directed. It says the same thing about the roller brush. Then I realized THAT'S why you get an extra set included in the box!Next, I realized that hair is what clogs the dirty water tank and gets stuck on the roller brush, prompting the self cleaning cycle. I have a household that includes a couple of dogs that shed a lot and several people with very long hair. So for me, doing a quick once over with a dust mop before using this machine works much better. Less hair means I can clean the floors for much longer before I have to clean the tank and the brush roller. If you don't have pet fur or a lot of human hair to deal with, you can skip the dust mopping but if you do have pets, be ready to stop a lot unless you use this machine almost every day to keep the hair and fur to a minimum. I also ordered 2 more HEPA filters and 2 more roller brushes so I can clean the entire apartment.It comes with a cleaning concentrate (which is awesome, BTW) but you can also clean with plain water.I have some unusual cleaning challenges. We had a house fire so we are living in an apartment until the house is repaired. We are working in the sooty house daily and come home covered in soot. I also have a broken wrist that is in a cast. Despite the hair challenges, this machine does an amazing job of cleaning up after us and I can manage it easily one handed. Although the owner's manual isn't the best, you will get the hang of it after using it a little and it's truly excellent. I will update if I have issues in the future but so far, I am very pleased with how well this works.UPDATE: I am now in love with this machine and cannot imagine life without it. My oldest dog is 18 and failing fast. We take her out in a doggy stroller because it is too far for her to walk and the other day, she had a pee accident in the hallway and elevator before I saw it. Tineco Floor One S3 to the rescue. I was able to clean the hallway and elevator floor quickly and easily. Have just ordered more cleaning solution because a) it's really good stuff and b) it will void your warranty if you use another brand.2nd UPDATE: I am still in love with this machine. My floors have never looked better and it's so quick and easy to clean up a sudden mess. Once you get used to cleaning the dirty water tank and refilling the clean water/cleaning solution tank a couple of times if you are cleaning ALL of your floors, it still saves you so much time and is much easier than even a swiffer and the floors are left very, very clean. Do learn from my mistake, though. Don't leave dirty water in the dirty water tank overnight - rinse it out right away after you are done cleaning. If you leave it overnight (or longer), the plastic tank will pick up a gross smell. If that happens, you need to clean it out and then let it sit with a bleach and water solution inside the tank for a day and then, maybe even let it sit out in the sun for a couple of hours to get rid of the smell. This won't happen if you clean out the tank right after you finish using it or after a self-cleaning cycle has been run. The machine will tell you to do this so listen to it.

    Customer service issue

  I really like this vacuum mop. Works great, easy to use. Unfortunately it stopped working within a year of owning it. I reached out to customer support on July 19th and was told to ship the whole vacuum back to them (so keep your box in case this happens to you!!) and they determined that the motor broke and they would be sending me a new unit, which I received on August 31st . Awesome! Except the new unit was filthy, clearly used, and the clean water tank was broken. I emailed them immediately (with the pictures in this review) and was told they would be sending a new clean water tank and would supply the shipping information when they ship it. Still waiting... super frustrated.

  I loved my tineco until it started having battery issuesAnd while it was under warranty the whole replacement process is horribleI sent mine in and they replaced it with another used one I guess they refurbished which would have been just fine but my replacement came and it was a unit that had quite a bit of wear and tear.Water was leaking out of it and all in the box. Which I provided them pictures of.They didn’t not send a filter with it even though they asked me to send in all my tineco parts.The shipping took forever.Now I’m stuck with a even crappier unit and no filter so I have to buy one and wait for it now.Updated they now tell me I have to wait another 2 weeks for a filter because they didn’t send a complete unit. This means because of the machine failure and return process I’ll be without my tineco for over a month!I’m telling you with a shark product they are always great to deal with!Tineco thanks but no thanks really

  I’ve waited over a month to write this review. I was very skeptical to purchase this, I’d never heard of the brand before my sister mentioned it. I read a lot of reviews, and finally purchased it when it went on sale because we were moving into a new home with a lot of hardwood floors and tile.  I’m so glad I did. I absolutely love that I can vacuum and mop at the same time, especially with a 2 year old after dinner. It sucks everything up- fresh spaghetti, rice, fruit, playdo… The previous owners of our new home had two large dogs. The floors appeared to be clean when we moved in, but for weeks I have been sucking sand and dog hair from between the hardwood floor boards. The water was black and murky, I knew it was working. I will definitely continue to use a regular mop to deep clean, but this does an amazing job upkeeping the floors and decreasing the amount of times I have to do that.I also didn’t know you shouldn’t apply a lot of water to hardwood floors. I can tell as I go room to room the vacuum is adjusting the water levels appropriately to not get them too wet.It’s very light weight, I just wish the cleaning solution was cheaper.

  I purchased this because I watched several tiktok videos comparing different brands of floor cleaners.  I previously had a floor cleaner and it was worn out so decided that I needed a new one.  This didn't disappoint.  Very pleased with my purchase.  I will say that my previous floor cleaner had scrub brushes that were able to get harder stuck on items off the floor, this one took a few more passes when it was something stuck on the floor, but I did the napkin test and this one hands down wins the prize for the cleanest floor after mopping!  I like the fact that I don't have to worry about vacuuming separately also.  Easy peasy clean up too - loving it so far.

  This machine looks aesthetically pleasing in your home. That’s it. I don’t understand all the good reviews because this thing only worked for a few months before the motor failed. And when it did work, it basically did nothing for my floors. The roller brush is poorly designed and does nothing for your floors but get them wet and halfway suck up the dirty water. It does not remove anything stuck or dried on your floor. This might be ok for people without kids or pets who also never go outside… but no me. I shipped it all the way back to Canada to be repaired and when I received it back it worked for a whole 2 days before it quit again! I could probably send it back again, but at this point I’m over it. A waste of $400.

It has great suction power picks up fries , top Ramen with no problem just to name some ,the next best think is it talks to you to let you know how the machine is working and if it needs water . Great product i will recommend to family and friends . P.s in the future it would be great if it had lights in the front .Update : do not buy this dam vacuum a wast of money and time , first of all it started leaking from the dirty water tank and then one day it just took a shit it won't self clean anymore and it keeps saying dirt water tank full and it's empty,  I will be going to Bissell they lots a good customer!!  11/27 updated

  Not impressed. My steam mop does a better job and sanitizes. Tineco leaves my floors smelling like wet dog and I don’t have a dog! This is also after the second use so it shouldn’t be that smelly! I didn’t think I had to touch anything gross with the Tineco but you absolutely do - you have to clean out the filter after each use and it’s super nasty. I would return this if we didn’t already throw out the packaging.

  She's everything I could have ever wanted and more. I have never been more in love with an appliance in my life. I've had her for a month now and I can't imagine how I lived life before her.She is ✨light weight✨and self propelled(almost like she glides across the floor like Kristi yamaguchi) so a!!!!!!!!!!GREAT PURCHASE FOR ELDERLY!!!!!!!!!!!or someone who has trouble cleaning floors. It takes very little effort or strength.I had not swept my kitchen in two weeks when she arrived. I put her straight to work and she showed no signs of struggle. she sucked up all the crubs and My toddlers mess with no issue. My floors look and FEEL amazing.I love the smell of the cleaner it comes with. Smells almost like original scent Softsoap hand soap or original febreeze scent. Very light and clean. Not overbearing or irritating if you have issues with strong fragrance.Doesn't leave the floor soaking wet. Very minimal water left behind and dries quickly.She even SELF CLEANS herself. What more could you want?She worked wonders for a hard clean when my floors were at their worst and is simple enough to use for quick 2 minute touch up at the end of each day with no fuss. I pull her out for small quick  spot clean ups.I bought the midrange model but now I'm curious how the $400 model works because I can't imagine how she could be any better.My mental health has increased 100% because every night I go to bed with clean floors. Nothing makes me sleep better than knowing my toddler can crawl across my floors without guilt.I could keep going but I think I'm starting to sound a little crazy. She's just the best thing that's ever happened to me. I bought the extended warranty because I would do anything for her and want to protect my girl at all cost.❤️🧹🧽If I had to say one bad thing about my baby, it's that the edges aren't perfect. I almost want a small handheld attachment. No one is perfect but my girl, tineco, is as close as they come.

  Vacuum and wet spinner are not working well for any type of mess. The vacuum picks up a quarter size of dog hair. If I run the Roomba after, I can fill up 2 more bins of dog hair and crumbs in the same room. It also cannot get any messes from under the high chair up and since it has to dry for 24 hours after each use, it never lines up with when I need it again. It also is very loud constantly reminding me to clean something, refill something, charge, so I can only use it in between naps with a baby on one hip then bending down to scrub every foot because it can't actually get anything up. I don't understand how it how this got good reviews. I saved up for 6 months for this, and it is useless to me.

  ******Update 8/30/21It's complete junk and customer service will give you the run around. I sent mine back due to the battery not charging. (Read other reviews, happens alot!) They told me they replaced the battery and sent it back. They did NOT!  In fact they did not even OPEN the box!! It was sent back to me packaged exactly how I had packed it, with newspaper packed in tight. I contacted them and they said they would send me a replacement, instead of trying to fix the battery on mine. My ""replacement"" arrived today, and the battery will charge, but it shuts off after 5 seconds. They replaced 1 problem, for another. Calling customer service is a toss up. You may get someone or you might be on hold for 5 minutes until they hang up on you. I wanted so bad to leave a wonderful update on how well customer service is and how helpful they are, but that IS NOT THE CASE! They tell you what you want to hear and make promises they cannot and will not keep.. Save your money and save your sanity!April 2021This wet vac is awesome!! At first I had issues with it blinking the self clean button, but once I was able to break it down and clean the suction area I found the problem (I sucked up a break tie) My floors have never been cleaner. I actually look forward to using it and the cleaning solution smells amazing! It takes a minute or two to get use to its functions but once you do you will wonder how you ever cleaned without it. It was definitely worth the money!

   Okay so let me start by saying I have wanted a competitors version of this for several years and just never hit buy due to the price. So when Tineco came out with this ifloor 3 with more features and a cheaper price than the competition, I decided to go for it. If you're anything like me you've seen this machine talked about on apps and blogs everywhere with great reviews and while it is a handy machine, it's not perfect. I didn't vaccum or mop for 5 days before I tried this so I could get a real feel for how well it cleaned.The suction is really great. It picks up almost as much as a vaccum would. Larger things get pushed around but for the most part it has nice suction. It is also SO quiet. I'm not sure how they made it so powerful and so quiet at the same time but they did a nice job with that!The water tanks are SMALL, my house is not large and I had to refill/dump 3 times just to do my kitchen and dining area. Not a super big deal but a little annoying.Next, this is supposed to come with cleaning solution and mine did not. I have not yet contacted the company to see if they will send me some, but I will update with how they handle this once I get a response.The maneuverability is almost too great Lol. When I turned it on it took off and slammed into the wall. I was not expecting it to be so peppy and it does get away from me at times. I actually like this though because your arm doesn't get exhausted from pushing a heavy machine back and forth.Finally, the mopping portion. This is where the machine let me down some. If you want to clean comparable to running a Swiffer across the floor, than this is perfect. However, if your mother is coming home for the Holidays and you need your floor, ""MOM IS COMING"" clean, this just doesn't do it. Like I said, I didn't mop for 5 days to really see how this did. There was a bit of cheap foundation of my floor that my lovely 2 year old spilled after trying to paint his hair with it, that it didn't even touch. There was also some dry ketchup because again...toddlers... and it did not get that up either.So, if you do a deep cleaning once a week and just want to use this for maintenance, I think it is perfect. If you're wanting to throw away your vaccum and mop and replace them with this, you're going to be disappointed.In all, I am giving 4 stars. I do love it and plan to keep and use it but the mopping part is not quite all it was hyped up to be.

  When I first got it I loved it. It’s really saved my back from all the extra pain. Easy to use but you can’t be lazy. Absolutely do not leave the dirty water in it until “tomorrow morning” that I’m too tired to clean it out time will make it smell terrible very quickly. The filter will have to be super cleaned. Ok so 7 months after getting it I had to send it in for repairs. It started making a strange noise and would not suck as good as it first did.  The process was not hard but it goes to Canada. Takes a while to get there alone. Now the disappointment was when I got it back. It was fixed but banged up. Dents everywhere and the roller protector was cracked. I did not send it like that. Very disappointing that I had to send it in for repairs only 7 months in and they didn’t treat it right while repairing it sucked. I take care of my stuff so no reason for any of it really. But yea. Isn’t all that bad but not worth the amount of money.

  I wish it held more clean water, and that the water could be hot. Also wish that it didn’t have to be emptied after every use. It’s kind of an ordeal to empty the dirty water tray because you need to pour it in the sink, and throw it away. If you don’t clean the dirty water tray after each use it will stink. It works great, our floors have never felt so clean. Just these few things that make it a little inconvenient to use. It surprises me at the amount of stuff it picks up, even tough to remove dried food in the kitchen will come up but it might take a little longer than most things. The floors feel buttery smooth when I’m done.Update - I find myself cleaning out the dirty water tank so often, I dread using it. If I knew what I know now, I would not have purchased. If the dirty water tank sits, it smells terrible. I have been going longer and longer in between using because the dirty water tank gets so nasty so easily. Too much maintenance.

  I bought a Tineco Cordless A11 a few years back and had been nothing but pleased with it's performance and if I ever had a question or problem (which were few and far between/mostly from something we did) their customer care went above and beyond. When I went down to visit my son I noticed my daughter in law had purchased an I floor 3 and she loved it so when I got back home I ordered one for us. My wife who is a fanatic when it comes to cleaning used it for the first time today and though we have 4 other machines including the A11 I think her rating of ""Nifty"" means she's highly impressed. I know I was. Tineco kills it when it comes to performance, usability and customer service so they have and always will get my vote.

","









  
  
    
  This vacuum is great, however for the price I expect more suction power. I love the fact that it’s two in one, vacuum and mopping. Is cordless that is a plus. The duration with constant use is around 30 min. I don’t like that the dirty water tanks get full fast so I need to changed before even give the automatic washed. If you don’t like to clean a discussion tank don’t buy it. Overall is a 4 stars for me. The roll doesn’t look that cleans completely the carpet, however for hardwood  floors or tiles is amazing.

I am very happy with the cleaningWater tank-  a little small but not a huge issueslightly difficult to clean the dirty water tank as it gets ""chunks"" of dirt in it. I did sweep up prior to using this but we all know a broom and dustpan doesn't get everything hence the appeal of a vacuum/mopoverall I would say I like it a lot for convenience!

   I have OLD terrazzo floors. They were neglected for years by the previous owners. We’re currently renovating and I needed something that could help keep our floors clean in between workers coming in and out of the house. Any how, this thing immediately cleaned up years of dirt and debris. Obviously my floors will need to be restored, but good lord look at that dirt!!! This is THE BEST and I would highly recommend it!!

  I absolutely love this I didn’t love the idea of spending $400 on a mop but oh my gosh! I knew our floors were dirty but I had no idea they were as bad as they were. It’s extremely easy to maneuver. I was in a serious car accident a few months ago leaving me with little mobility of my left arm and I am still able to use the mop with that arm. The vacuum guides across the floor you basically just steer. I would 10/10 recommend this product I absolutely love it.

  I’ve been using this for the past month now and I’m not disappointed at all. I can’t believe how much dirt this has pulled off my floors. I’m amazed. This is the best thing I’ve ever purchased. The only thing I don’t like about this is it’s like cleaning a carpet cleaner with the dirty water and debris it pulled off the floor, I wish there were separate tanks. Also do yourself a favor and buy and extra brush roller so you always have a clean one.

  LOVE - I saw this on Tik Tok and thought that this would be a great purchase. The only reason that I'm giving it four stars is that the size of the clean water tank and dirty water tank are the only downfalls. I find myself stopping frequently and I don't even have a lot of square footage. So if you are getting this for a large space, you will be stopping and starting frequently. But definitely a lot easier to clean than sweeping and then mopping.

  I love this! I only use it about once a week but it does so well on our hardwood floors and bathroom tile. We have two pups and I am always amazed how much hair it picks up. We have a robot vacuum that we use every day. Only downfall is cleaning out all of the hair, but that just means it’s working! I am able to clean our kitchen, dinning room and bathrooms when it is fully charged.

  I have really liked this utility device for my hardwood and tile floors. I am amazed at how dirty the water is after I run it over the kitchen floor. I don’t have pets and it’s just 2 of us, so the cleanup is pretty much dirty water, but there are some hairs and crumbs and things I. The dirty water that require rinsing off. We have a utility sink in the garage, so that’s where that happens. The only negative so far is that the tanks are small, so you constantly have to empty, rinse, and clean dirty water tank and fill the clean water tank. It usually takes me a minimum of three times doing this process to clean my house. Also to get around the toilet areas in the bathroom is impossible on one side because the roller is too wide. I wish there was an additional smaller roller to adapt to this situation.

  If this was closer to $75-$100 - absolutely.  But for over $300 it is not worth it.  It leaves about a 2 inch gap around corners, ours also constantly sounds like something is dragging on the floor.  All the parts need to be left out to dry - so once your floors are clean, you'll have 30 parts spread across your counter top for the day drying out.  Even with doing that - they ALL start to smell after a few weeks.

  I purchased the Tineco iFloor 3 -- Day one of use... First impressions:After having purchased and put this together (easy to assemble) I began to have doubts if it was a smart purchase for me. I was suddenly self-conscious about the fact that I have large area rugs and don't have as much space where I need to  clean hard floors as I use to. I was concerned that if it was very sloppy I wouldn't be able to clean right up around my rugs. Also, I began realizing how much furniture I normally sweep under, at very least the edges. I started to feel as if this might be something that you use and then still have to go back and ""clean the other half"". As doubts creeped in I let my new appliance sit on it's charging dock awaiting it's first use. Last night I had a bedroom I wanted to clean and decided it was time to give this thing it's first trial run. I used it without solution as I didn't have any sticky messes, spills, or extra muck to clean. This thing is amazing and addictive. I already never want to sweep and mop the old way ever again... It is basically self propelled so it kind of pulls you along naturally and easily. You put more effort in pulling it back to you. It swivels and maneuvers beautifully. If you're the type of person who gets irritated after sweeping because you hate that one little bit of dust you can't ever get in the dustpan, you'll love this. It has great suction and makes all dust and dirt disappear in one swipe and even seems to suction the dirt that is within a quarter inch (maybe more) of it's path. The design was well thought out because all of that furniture I knew I'd want to get under wasn't a problem. The head of this is not bulky and as such is able to better access under furniture than a standard vacuum. This leaves so little residue and dries very quickly. The floor appears more damp than wet after using this all-in-one cleaner. I was not at all concerned to clean right up around the edges of my rugs. Once I started, I just wanted to keep going. I ended up cleaning down the hallway and into my living room. I think that's always a positive sign. No, you probably cannot clean ALL of the way under your furniture without moving it. But I definitely did not finish feeling like I had to go back to clean my corners, under the edges of my furniture, or around my rugs. So that was a huge relief.My only con is that when you go to clean this out, it is very much like cleaning out a carpet cleaner... And there is going to be all of the chunky things and hair you swept off of your floor in your dirty tank. So, I was hesitant to rinse the dirty water tank in my sink or tub. I dumped the tank outside and decided to rinse in my tub. Then I had to wipe out my tub. I think in the future I may utilize a bucket of water to rinse out the dirty water tank so that residue can also be dumped outside. Really this is a small con... The dirt, hair, and mess had to go somewhere. And all of the pieces to the dirty water tank, clean water tank, and to remove the roller come apart and fit back together well. This does have a self cleaning option. But the tag instructs you to clean your appliance roller yourself after each use for best results. Perhaps the self cleaning option is meant for ""in between"" times of same day uses?Overall, this is easy to use, easy to assemble, easy to clean, well designed, and most importantly feels like it does a great job cleaning. It has great suction and maneuverability. So far, fantastic product.

  Hands down the best product I’ve ever purchased. I did extensive research on this and it’s competitor the bissell crosswave, & I decided with this product based on reviews. I only wish I would’ve bought this sooner. I have zero complaints thus far and I’ve had it about 2 months and used it probably 30+ times already to do my entire house.-my house is 2200+ square feet and I can easily do my entire house on the basic setting (not the max) without the battery going dead. I sometimes have to turn on the max setting just to kill the battery so I can plug it in when I’m done.-my MIL purchased the bissell crosswave about a month ago and I used it to vacuum her house to compare. I like that the bissell does rugs, but it seems to push dirty water around the floor due to letting the user decide how much water is used while mopping where as the ifloor does all the work for you and doesn’t disperse too much water so you never push dirty water around. Bissell is a plug in and I didn’t notice a difference in suction power between the two which surprised me! The Ifloor vacuum will suction things off the floor that my dyson won’t even vacuum up.This is an amazing product, I waited a long time to purchase because i was skeptical due to the price. It’s worth every penny plus more!!

    Life Changing Vacuum for Pet Hair
  
","









  
  
    
  I used to use a Roomba and then mop my floors after that.  The whole process was so time consuming.  In order for the Roomba to really work well, I basically had to move everything off my floors and onto my tables or countertops so it would not be impeded while cleaning.  And the Roomba would take over an hour to clear my whole 1st floor.  And once the vacuum was done, I'd have to mop and then wait for the floor to dry before putting everything back in place.  The Tineco takes about 7 minutes to both vacuum and mop my whole floor.  And it uses so little water that the floor dries almost instantly.  So I can just move my furniture out of the way while vacuuming and then put it right back.  It's so easy I use it several times a week and my floors have never been cleaner.  I own 3 cats and one dog so keeping my floors looking clean is a challenge.  And it cleans itself when you're done!!!  I will say that the first time I used it, I had not cleaned my floors for over two weeks and I had to stop and self-clean the vacuum about 4 times because there was so much animal hair.  And it would run out of water while self cleaning and then the dirty water tank got full several times and I had to stop to empty that.  It seemed like it was going to be a process every time I wanted to clean my floors.  But once I got the initial disaster that my floor was cleaned up, it's been really easy to maintain and it takes way less time to do my whole floor.  One tank of clean water will clean my whole floor, then I self clean the vacuum and empty the dirty water tank.  So easy.  I love walking around on my floors now in my bare feet.  Nothing gross sticks to the bottom of my feet anymore!!

  I love the Floor One 3. The deep suction is okay but the maneuverability is outstanding. Only thing is that the top tank doesn’t slide in easily and requires some effort to fit it into the socket. The self cleaner is very nice however water pools in the bottom tray. I’ve contacted the company via email. Hopefully I will hear back soon. The Floor One 3 concept is great! Hopefully I can get a replacement soon to fully enjoy all of its features. I’ve contacted the Tineco company regarding another product that stopped working after 3 or 4 uses. I like their products. I just wish they would work properly for more than a few usages. I’ll post an update as soon as I know more.

  I bought 2 Bissell Crosswaves in 2 years, and they both had the same problems. Constantly stopping to indicate that the dirty water tank was full when it was empty, leaving black water on the floor, and both of the rollers stopped turning. I love the cordless floor wash & vacuum cleaner.  I don’t ever want to go back to a mop & bucket again.  But it was time to look for another brand, especially for $400.  I was hesitant to buy the Tineco because I wasn’t familiar with the brand, but the reviews convinced me.  I’M SO GLAD I BOUGHT THIS MACHINE!!!  This is the one!!!I love how quiet it is, and how it just straight up does the job. No clogging, no stopping unless the dirty tank is really full, or the clean tank is really empty.  Self-cleaning, and self-propelled (a bonus feature that the Crosswave doesn’t have). I’m in love!!!!  I wish it had a variety of brush rollers (mop, scrub, etc.), but it’s not a gripe - just a wish list item. I like the display, which shows how much battery time is left before it has to be charged.  None of the machines of this type that I have researched so far have an exchangeable battery, so I just ordered another, less expensive Tineco iFloor model to finish the job when the battery dies.  I have 2 chihuahuas & I’m constantly cleaning the floor, and I need a floor cleaner that is reliable & works. This is it.  I just ordered more cleaning solution (a small capful goes a long way) & replacement brush rolls & filters. The only test now, is the test of time. I’m hoping to get 2 years out of it. If I do, then Tineco will keep my 5 stars.  For now, I’m thrilled!

  I’ve had this for about 4 months now. Just like anything else there’s thing I love and things I’m like eh. Definitely amazing, it cleans so lovely & I love that I can do my living room area rug! Love the 2 in one concept, vacuuming and cleaning. Saves a step in my life especially with two kids and two dogs! I struggle finding a vacuum that hair doesn’t get tangled in the roller, this can pretty much suck up anything without getting clogged.  The eh part is having the two dogs, if there’s an accident in the house I use my tineco to vacuum it, no harm right? Wrong, if you don’t self clean it after every dog accident it smells awful. After awhile no matter what you use your mop vac to clean cyour brush roller a little stinky even with the self clean concept. The cleaning liquid it comes with is amazing smells awesome and doesn’t leave streaks on my hard woods.  I usually have to throw my roller brush the washer for a good clean or just buy a replacement which can start to get pricy. All in all I give it a 4 out of 5.

  I have been a Tineco customer for years now, and I absolutely love the machine; however, back in November 2021 my machine no longer suctioned and it turns out there was a motor failure. Under warranty still, Tineco quickly sent me a replacement machine. Fast forward only two months and my replacement stopped working. Guess what? Motor failure once again. I still have the very first Tineco floor machine that I purchased when it came out and it still works flawlessly. I feel as if the newer machines are made much cheaper at a much more rapid pace and as a result they are lower quality. I take excellent care of my machines and always follow instructions for proper care, so I know for a fact that it’s not something I’ve done. I went from a highly satisfied customer to disappointed when my first one S3 broke. I was grateful for the excellent customer service and how quickly my issue was addressed, so I was satisfied once more. Then within two months my brand new replacement machine had the same issue as the last. Now I am a not-so-satisfied customer and I almost feel like I have been ripped off by Tineco after spending nearly $1,000 with the company over the years. My machine is currently being looked at for “repairs” by Tineco. Hopefully, I get an outcome I can live with.

  This thing kicked a$$—until it didn’t.  Like many others, the internal battery died very soon after I started using it, and rather than sending a replacement battery, they wanted me to ship the entire unit back and send a replacement.  Seeing as that’s been a failure for other buyers, I’m going to see if I can replace the battery myself.  It was a freaking great mop, but the poor customer service and lack of ability to make simple repairs to solve a known, recurring issue is a deal-breaker.  I hate cleaning my SpinWave, but at least it freaking works.

  My cleaning lady was just here yesterday and then this baby finally showed up today. We have a puppy so we are in and out the back door often .

Will update if I have any issues, but so far I'm sold. I didn't have any streak issues when drying like other people have complained of.

  I don't know what I did all these years without this floor cleaner. This thing is awesome! It takes just a few minutes to scrub the floor. No need to sweep first then mop. This baby does it all. I can scrub my entire house in 20 minutes instead of an hour or more. Cleans it self to. Highly recommend. Love it!

  Great quick way to clean floors. Initial first cleaning battery didn't last long even after a charge, but since then battery lasts a lot longer. Wish the water containers were bigger. I find myself having to stop in the middle of finishing my floors to empty the dirty water, run a cleaning cycle, just to do that all over again to finish the floors. I registered my product online and had to make a claim same day for the rubber on the dirty tank being broken. They sent me a brand new tank, no charge in like 3 days. Great company!

    A lifesaver
  
","









  
  
    
  Let me first start off by saying I despise cleaning. Mopping was only reserved for special occasions/when absolutely necessary. Since having the Tineco, our floors have been vacuumed and mopped everyday, or every other day at least. Overall, I think it vacuums very well. I have laminate floors and the Tineco won’t get every mark that’s left on the floor. So, some actually scrubbing is needed for tougher/stuck stuff. However, my mom has tile floor and she borrowed the Tineco. It removed the marks with ease on her floor. I think the Tineco is great, but, for deep cleaning, it may only work well with certain floors. I would highly recommend either way

  I brought this cleaner because I'm lazy. I wouldn't say its very disappointed ,but I have too much thought on it.First of all its an nice cleaner it could clean and mop at the sometime but, the water container is too small. I clean my first floor it have to reload the water twice.Second it can't take the stain off the floor.WELL at the last I'm still going to keep it cuz I'm lazy it still could cleaner the floor an mop it so. just keep in mind that it's ok items

  I have luxury vinyl plank floors throughout my house and hate to sweep or vacuum and then have to mop. The Tineco takes care of that problem. There are two adults and 3 indoor cats in our household and I have been using the mop once a week. I can not believe how much dirt I get up each time I use it. I like that it is light weight, quiet and easy to clean. It has sufficient battery power for me to do the main part of the house and still have enough power to use the self cleaning feature.

  Bought the Tineco One S3 vacuum a few months ago and it already started malfunction (leaks liquids, doesnt charge fully, and self-cleaning often wont start).You can send it back to Tineco to repair, but expect to go 5+ weeks without a vacuum in the meantime.Tineco support team says it’ll take 48-72hrs to repair, but it’ll really take 5+ weeks (2 weeks of them misplacing the vacuum, 1-2 weeks of actual repair time, 2+ weeks of creating a FedEx return label but not actually shipping it out).Dont bother emailing them for status updates when the repair process is delayed. I’ve sent them 3 emails recently to check on the status, and they’ve all gone without response.

  This thing is a game changer. My kids want to help clean the floors now. It is so easy to use and it sucks up many things my cordless fusion wouldn't suck up. I love that it mops while it vaccums. Such a time saver. I used to sweep/mom/sweep to get my floors looking as good as this Tineco does. If you have the money I’d go with this one over the model a step down. The app and the talking to you features make it really easy to remember to clean everything and have it ready to go for next time. Plus it comes with an extra brush.

  I was a little worried to purchase but so happy i did.  I have hardwoods and tile with area rugs.  We have larger home with inside shedding dog.  I love this vacuum mop!  I used a vacuum them swiffer mopped prior to this purchase.  I hated mopping it hurt my back and never felt clean for long.  But now!  So fast and easy to have floors clean.  I can wipe floors with papertowel a day or 2 after using tineco and paper towel is still white!  So easy to use! Battery lasts for entire house, can handle area rugs, dog hair, human hair.  The inly things i wish i could change is larger clean water tank, that it could get closer to corners/edges, i wish it would function under beds or low furniture but the roller lifts off floor and doesnt clean.  Overall very satisfied!

  Good for light cleaning, no need to clean the roller brush frequently. However after nine months of use, stopped working. Troubleshooting with the company did not work. Further troubleshooting required video submission, Customer Service is Chinese based, difficult to understand and communicate with. Thought it was not worth the trouble. Going back to traditional mop. Another example why we should avoid Chinesium products.

  So far I really like it! I absolutely hate sweeping and even though I dont mind mopping (or using our Swifer Wetjet), I still had to sweep beforehand and it takes forever. This device was easy to put together and easy to work. I managed to clean our laundry room, hallway, and about 1/3 of the kitchen on one tank and in about 10-15 mins. I could have refilled it and kept going but I just wanted to try it out today and am waiting until later to run it through the rest of my house.Pros-•Quieter than I expected.•Only needs a cap full of the included cleaning solution.•Doesn't leave the floor soaking wet.•Did well with dog hair and dried on stains.•I only used it on ECO mode and not MAX but it got the job done.•Pretty easy to empty and clean the dirty tank. I just dumped the dirty water and debris out in the toilet and gave the tank a rinse.•Self cleaning mode worked well and quickly.•It kind of propels itself so its super easy to push around.•Significantly cuts down on time because I dont have to sweep beforehand, which is a dream.•The clean water/solution tank lasts longer than expected.The one and only con I have so far is that I can't get super close to the edges of the walls and baseboards. I tried going along the edges with the side of the mop and then tried to see how close I could get with the front, but still couldn't get it closer than about an inch from the wall. Its not a huge deal, but its definitely a bit of an inconvenience.So far, I'd give it a 4 out of 5 rating based on this first impression.

  I typically do not write reviews but I thought I would so others don’t make the same mistake I did! I heard great things about this item so instead of going with the Bissell cross wave cordless, I went with this. Mistake! It broke on me within a month. The suction stopped working and the item kept saying it was needing a self clean but wouldn’t self clean as it is stuck on the “max” indicator light. It says it’s clogged, but won’t self clean at all. I matter what troubleshooting steps I’ve tried (see picture attached). Additionally, customer service is so hard to reach. There’s a number listed but goes to voicemail. I tried 4 times and my boyfriend tried another time, nothing. Eventually I reached out via fb and asked for a call. They finally called back and asked me to send videos. For almost 2 weeks now I’m sitting with a $300 broken item I just purchased. Per the customer service lady, after a year they need replacing “sometimes”!!! It’s been a month but even if it was a year I’d be upset... this should not happen with this expensive of an item. Do not recommend. Customer service is not good and neither is the product since it only lasts a month without problems.

  Don't waste your money! I was so excited to get this, but was quickly very disappointed. The self clean button comes on every 5 minutes so you are supposed to stop cleaning, dock it, let it run the self clean cycle, then resume. I did my kitchen, dining room, hallway and living room and had to stop three times to self clean. You would think it would make it through one battery cycle before you had to stop and self clean! Battery still had 2 bars, and my floors were practically spotless to begin with! I have no pets in the house and there was nothing on the floors except a couple of tiny crumbs from where my son ate dinner! I had to dump the dirty water tank once during cleaning and again during one of the self clean cycles. Plus the headache of taking everything apart and cleaning everything when you are fully done cleaning!! After all that, my hardwood floors were streaked up everywhere!! This thing is a pain in the butt and a piece of junk!! It's worth maybe $50! I've packed it up after two uses and sending it back!

  After just a few uses it started leaving water on the floor like it isn’t sucking right. I’ve cleaned it so many times. No matter how much I clean the roller always starts to smell bad. Doesn’t clean tile well at all. Takes way more passes to clean than a normal mop. Also won’t suck anything larger than a grain of rice. Has to be charged 3 times to clean my house. Also I have to empty it and put new water in it every 3 minutes because the containers are so small. I’ve used more cleaner running a self cleaning cycle than actually cleaning my floor. Ants getting the containers back on right is so finicky and if even slightly off it will poor all the dirty water straight on the floor or will run with no clean water going through.

  If you are looking for something that is better than a mop, something to deep clean, or get moderately dirty floors clean, then keep your old tried and true mop and bucket. I have NO idea what all there good reviews are talking about. We have light laminate flooring and white/tan tile in the bathrooms, and this thing barely got up the stuff I just KNEW would be a breeze. So if it didn’t get the “easy breezy” stuff you KNOW it didn’t get the harder stuff. We have 2 puppies and a household of 6 and barely there footprints was all it got up. Our bathroom isn’t that big, and I had to empty the dirty water and refill the clean. The other spaces are much bigger and I was trying to go as fast as possible, but you will spend A LOT of time emptying and refilling the tanks. I don’t understand what it did!??!?! I tried swiveling it over a spot on the floor, I tried going over it more than once (different directions), and I tried going VERY slow over and NOTHING. For $400 this thing should have almost been able to run automatically w/o guidance. I was stuck with the Bissell Crosswave and I refuse to waste another timeframe to send this back. If you are a meticulous, detailed person who KNOWS how to clean, clean...run and save your money.

I now broom the larger chunks, then get the vac out.  HUGE timesaver, and does a great job!!!  The self cleaning is a bonus, too.  It did streak the floor first time, so I just use warm water now.  Much better!UPDATE 7/20:  My 4 month old machine will not charge properly.  I’ve been emailing back and forth for several days, and my case just got transferred to another dept.  Not impressed with CS!!!UPDATE 8/20:  The mfg is standing by their two year warranty and sending a new vac.  They also paid for return shipping!  Regardless, I love the concept of vac and mopping in one step.  Saves a huge amount of time!  I hope this one holds out longer, and I thank the mfg for being true to their word.

  We ordered this TineCo to replace the first unit that malfunctioned (the MAX light began blinking after only 4 months of use and the unit would not turn on and stay on). We were told this was a motor issue, when our first unit malfunctioned.Both units we’ve owned have only worked for 4-5 months before breaking. We had been using it once a week on engineered hardwoods - not any strenuous work for the vac/mop. When it works it works great. But how can something so expensive crap out after 4-5 months?Customer service is a challenge since they are located in China and there is a delay in correspondence. They want to send us a new unit and will not give us our money back. This is the second unit that we’ve experienced this same issue. Clearly there is a problem with the machine. I don’t want another unit, I just want a refund. I’m done trying my luck with Tineco.

  This is great for getting hard floors clean (I have tile floors)!

  Used for deep cleaning of hardwood floors and ceramic tile floors.  No streaking is what I like best about it.

  December 3, 2021: I was using a Miele ($700) vacuum and a Bissell spin wave cordless ($150) to clean my hardwood floors. I vacuumed daily, mopped like every two weeks. Honestly, it’s a lot of work just to vacuum- then to mop 3,500 sq ft? Difficult to do as often as I’d like. When I saw this two in one- I jumped at a chance to buy it. It was $300 - steep but given the amount of cleaning I have to do, well, it seemed worth it. I read reviews and though there are some outliers, most seemed ecstatic at its overall performance.The assembly is super easy and though I did read instructions, I guessed before how to assemble it. It came with cleaning solution and you only use one small cap with the tank. That tank lasted me about 1,200 sq ft. The battery lasted about 1,700 sq ft. The Bissell wave battery lasted only half of that.Cleaning the water and filters is so easy/ and almost oddly satisfying bc you can see everything that was picked up. I have hardwood floors throughout my house for the exception of three bathrooms that have tile. I tried it on tile and it worked. It needed more time to suction things it was suctioning quickly on wood floor, but honestly it could have been the auto setting was lowered. I didn’t check.The dirty spots on the floor needed several back and forth rounds to clean- so this isn’t a deep cleaning mop. Corners and edges are a challenge if not impossible. So, this does not eliminate my mop or my vacuum, but this beaut shortens the amount I use them and the time it takes to clean my floors. All in all, I’m happy with the first performance of this product! If any new things come up- I’ll update!

    It's Time You Upgraded your Swiffer Sweeper & Enter the Adult 2.0 League of Cleanliness
  
","









  
  
    
  Damn, can we just appreciate some cleaning tool technology feats here? It's a wet mop & vacuum that's perfect for hardwood floors...& it's cordless! AMAZING. If the thought of a really clean kitchen floor turns you on, buy this vacuum. But look, I get it. This thing is pricey, especially if you're a millennial with a somewhat decent paying job & student loans to pay off. Why spend your hard-earned cash on a vacuum/mop combo when a Swiffer Sweeper Wetjet seems like it should be good enough? For those who are fortunate enough to have disposable income they haven't YOLO'd into GME, it's time for you to upgrade from that Swiffer to a Tineco. It'll change your life & you will have absolutely NO RAGRATS.Clean-up is so easy with this bad boy. It's sleek, lightweight, & astonishingly easy to use & clean. Yes, you have to clean the cleaning tool. Welcome to adulthood, don't be lazy, it's necessary to maintain the integrity of the vacuum.This is the perfect tool for apartments or houses with hardwood or tiled floors. However, I will say that while this vacuum is fantastic at cleaning & sucking up things in open spaces, it fails to suction up debris near edges or walls. The suction isn't powerful enough (even on max) to grab things right near a wall. My recommendation is to sweep any spilled messes to the middle of the floor & then go HAM. If you spill soil from your plants, that won't be a problem to suction up, but if you try to suction up foliage--such as palm leaves or dead leaves--just don't. Sweep those things up, y'all--they're not meant to be vacuumed. Other than that, it's a 10/10 would recommend.If you're deciding between a Dyson or this Tineco, you're comparing different tools for different jobs. Think about what you really need to clean (kitchen where there's wet things or carpet, stairs, & mostly dry yuckies) & then make a decision. This vacuum/mop combo is fantastic for kitchen, bathroom, & living room cleanups. This doesn't mean it's not good for suctioning up dry mess, it just means you shouldn't be using it on carpets because the roller brush will just spread dirt all over it.The autoclean mechanic works great, making clean up a breeze. Dump out the dirty water tank in your sink & bin the chunkier debris. The battery charges pretty quickly & you get a solid battery life before it dies. If you're spending more than 35 minutes vacuuming, your house is either way too filthy or just way too enormous (must be nice). As a wet vacuum, this is one of the best cleaning tools to have in your arsenal & it is a DELIGHT to use. The suction is so powerful that it practically drives itself (again, with the exception of edges). Dried spills easily come away when you roll over them SLOWLY a few times.If you have a lot of carpet in the house or rugs or you need to clean a lot of stairs & this is your main concern, go with a Dyson. They're the best vacuums on the market with the best suction & you can convert them into a smaller handheld vacuum to get those hard-to-reach spots & stairs.Overall, I wouldn't go so far as to say that this product will replace any vacuum you have, especially if your vacuum has the ability to be converted to a smaller unit to grab small messes, but it will replace your mop! Upgrade your crappy mop, y'all. It's time you got a Tineco.

   Let me start by saying I waited about a month before leaving a detailed review. I have the Floor One S3 model, purchased on Black Friday for 30% off ($280). Attached is a video of it cleaning up underneath my sons high chair. The vacuum part works amazingly well, like even better than my cordless stick vacuum. Initially, I was a little disappointed that it didn’t mop the floors as well as I’d hoped. However, after using it consistently for a few weeks I am in love with it. I use it 2 times a week- on Wednesday & Sunday. I steam mop behind it about every 2 weeks. I use my stick vac in between uses for quick clean ups.I would have totally threw out my stick vac if this thing didn’t require thorough cleaning after each use. It’s not really hard to clean, it is just time consuming to wash all the parts and allow them to air dry after every use. You absolutely want to clean it immediately after every use... I let it sit for one day when I first got it and it smelled disgusting.So I say all that to say this- if you plan to use only this to mop your floors then you will probably be a little disappointed. I have found that it keeps the floors very clean when using 2x a week and doing a deep clean with the steam mop every two weeks. If you’re looking for something hardcore then this probably is not for you.If you’re looking for something to quickly clean your high traffic (toddler moms, I’m talking to you) floors multiple times a week because you’re a little OCD about having clean floors, then buy it ASAP! Just know that you will want to do a deep clean with a regular mop or steam mop once or twice a month so that it keeps performing great. Overall, I absolutely love it. Instead of using my stick vac multiple times a week and the steam mop once a week, I get to use this 2x a week to vacuum and get the added bonus of a quick mop at the same time.Love love love it.

    Need maintenance in between use
  
","









  
  
    
  It is a great product, but needs to be self cleaned quite often during use.  Water needs to be dumped quite often.  I wanted an item that I can use very easily, but this one needs cleaned up or else the item gets mildew smell and bad odor happens, this needs to be cleaned and dried in between use, so that part was not convenient.  Needs to be babysat cleaned quite often, and I sure do since it is quite expensive and want to last long for me.  The tank is small, thus more water needs to be added quite often and dirty water dumped quite often.  Also it can’t reach to the edge of wall, so edge of wall cannot be cleaned as you want.  It has a power to run forward on its own.  Also drips of water happens while not in use and transporting, which is annoying .  Overall it is a great product, as good as it gets, I think.

  I must be the only person on earth who doesn’t like this vacuum. It doesn’t get up against the walls at all. You have to sweep everything away from the baseboards before using it then you have to go around the baseboards with a regular mop for all of the edges it misses. It’s not worth the price to still have to use 3 different things to get the job done .

  Yall, I’m not a person to buy stuff for myself I’m really not. Especially the price of this I was extremely hesitant about it. While their is cheaper brands you get what you pay for. This thing is amazing! I have 2 kids a toddler and a 8 month old and they are both extremely dirty kids. Always spilling something, getting into my eggs, etc. I also have 2 rowdy pits. They knock over soda cans on tables, messy drinkers, just plain nasty. This thing will clean up that sticky soda and dog slobber like it’s nothing. My kid likes to draw on my floors with chalk (I know it’s an easy clean up with a rag etc) this thing gets it up with little to no effort. The only downside of this for me would be the fact it has a small water tank. I have a huge 2 story house and I have to refill between rooms which isn’t a problem I just wish it was bigger. Oh and this thing self cleans. Definitely better than a bissel crosswave or any of its competitors.

  Do not let the internet or TikTok fool you. This has the suction power of a garden hose. If you'd like to spend half or your time dumping out the water tank and refilling, have fun with that. The entire tank can't even clean my tiny living room. I am constantly having to go back to the sink to refill. My house is 1,500 sq feet. If I want to do my entire house, I better be prepared for an hour of work. This thing is BS. Do not let the persuasive people let you believe that this thing is actually worth $400. Wow. I feel so played. I can't believe they screwed me over like this. I was 2 days past my delivery window and now I am stuck with this thing. I should've bought the crosswave.

  i bought this because i saw it all over tiktok and every one went on and on about how great it was. i read a lot of reviews and finally decided to pull the plug on the price and buy it. is it helpful cleaning up a spill? yes.. much quicker and easier than dragging out the old mop and bucket. BUT if you have pets with long hair, id skip over this. i vacuum prior to using the tineco and still it gets clogged up with hair after doing a small area. also, the water tanks are small, leaving them to need refilled pretty quickly. another thing to consider is if you have textured floors. i have textured vinyl plank flooring and it definitely does not leave my floors clean like i saw people claim on tiktok. and now, within 3 months of buying this $300 machine it is broken. so we will see how easy the customer service and the warranty process is....... needless to say i cannot say i recommend this product

  I've had this product for 4 months now. What I really like about it: fast, cordless, easy maneuverability. What I dislike about it: cleaning the parts, suction could be a bit better, cleaning solution that comes with it.I have 3 dogs and 1 cat. One of the dogs is a husky, which sheds enough for the other three animals. This mopvac does not do the trick when it comes to picking up the husky hair. It clogs way too fast and I felt like I was clearing it out every other pass of the floor. Even though this is supposed to do the job of a mop and vacuum at the same time, I started to do a quick vacuum in the areas where my dogs hair really gathered. And that made mopping with the Tineco much easier. I know it kind of defeats the purpose, but it's still faster to do both this way than use a mop/bucket.I think if this was a larger mopvac, it may do the trick with all the animal hair. But for the most part, I love how quick I can clean the floors in my home. The rainy season has me using this just about every 2-3 days, and it cleans up the muddy paw prints perfectly. I'm curious if any other cleaning solution will work in it because the Tineco solution is a bit streaky on my floors.Overall, great product, would definitely purchase again and I've influenced several family and friends to purchase as well!

  I'm happy with it and definitely plan to keep it.  It works well for spot cleaning, spills, and normal dirt and the like.On my travertine tile floors or doesn't pick up all the water, like it shows in the video, but when I empty the dirty water tank the water is filthy brown and the filter is full of dog and cat hair.  So it works well - it just tends to leave my floors a bit damp.The self cleaning mode works great and the roller brush comes very clean.I've yet to figure out why I need a WiFi connection to it but it's there in case I ever do.  The battery level read out is nice and looks to be accurate.  I've never run out of battery life while cleaning about 2,000 sq ft of tile floors and 600 sq ft of hardwood floors - which are also left with a fine film of clean water when I'm done.It does pretty well cleaning small amounts of litter that cats paws carry onto the floor around the litter box but I sweep larger litter spills up first because it tends to get stuck on the roller.So it doesn't do as well with larger solid materials s as it does with liquids or fine dirt - which it does a really good job with.

  My daughter has been looking for the perfect solution to help her clean up after her furry kids and stay ahead of the game. She has purchased several vacuums, and steam mops and the time it took for each made the task daunting. She also purchased new floors that discouraged steam mops. She came across this product and figured she would give it a try, she loves it and I have tried it and also love it! It is lightweight, the dual purpose of vacuum and mopping without steam is awesome. Her floors have never looked so good and the ease of use no longer makes the task so overwhelming when keeping up with the dogs. I love that the dirt is collected in the water and you just need to dispose of the water and the mop is self cleaning when in the base. Awesome product! We will be purchasing another for me :)

   Amazing wet dry vacuum! Does amazing cleaning our tile and hardwood floors. Love the cleaning solution too! Does not leave floors sticky or any residue and dries pretty quickly as well. This has been a major game changer for us especially having pets. 1 charge is perfect for the main floor where we use it! I love the lights to tell when it passes over something I may not notice as well, especially over the grout lines.

    Best for light to moderate cleaning

  Overall, this is best suited for very flat floors that don't get too dirty. If you live someplace where much dirt gets tracked in, such as in the country, the brush doesn't scrub hard enough to remove all the dirt. It also won't scrub very deep, so it won't clean cracks or grout channels. The small reservoirs also mean many trips to the sink. For my floors, a deck brush and a shop vac do a better job. If your floors don't need a deep cleaning, it's a good buy.The run time hasn't been an issue; by the time it needs a recharge, I've finished cleaning.

  I am obsessed!  I was hesitant to spend the $$ on a “fancy mop”, but this is worth its weight in gold.  The battery charges quickly, the suction power is great!  And the floor is so clean, no streaks, no sticky residue, and they dried QUICKLY.  The cleanup afterwards is really just a quick rinse of the filter and dirty water tank, after the brush roller self cleans, it’s easily popped out to dry in the drying rack.  I only wish I had discovered this sooner, I have wasted so much $$ on other products.

  Why didn’t I buy this sooner!!!! Not a paid review either (if that’s actually real). I did my research online for all of the robot mops. I posted on fb which one to buy. Many people recommended this so I got it! I opened it as soon as I got home. The packaging was nice. Easy to put together. It works amazing!!!!! The only downside is the battery life, I was able to get 80% of my downstairs before it went dead. I can’t wait to use it again tomorrow. So happy with the turnout!!!! Worth the money 💯

  Got this as a house warming gift and it has changed my life! My floors are so much cleaner with 2 kids and 3 dogs. I vacuumed then used this because I was scared about the amount of dog hair and it still picked up a ton of dog hair. My kid smeared an Oreo all over the hardwood floor and this cleaned it right up. I had to go over it like 3-4 times but it was clean. Only negative thing I have to say is that I can’t get into small spaces with this. You will probably have to eventually mop with a regular mop and bucket to get the hard to reach places but this product is 100% worth every penny. If it breaks I will 100% but another one for the ease it makes keeping my house clean.

  I’ve only used it once so far, but so far so good. It does leave behind a small amount of water on the floor when you prop it upright to pause and empty the dirty water tank.

Also my tile wood is dark in one room and it looks like a mess was wiped. It left a film on the dark floors. I wish it had a hand piece for between the fridge and for tight places.

It is under warranty so no issue... until you try to get it replaced. I am still waiting to find out when they are even going to ship the replacement 11 days later. I have emailed several times and NO response. I even looked to see if I could buy a replacement part for it thinking I could get it quicker, but the clean water tank isn't available for purchase. Great machine... when you have all the working pieces.

  My daughter planned to get this, and thought I should order one, too.  Well, this little item is a life changer (or, at least, floor cleaning changer)!  No more slopping water to mop, no bucket, beats my spray mop!!- The amount of vacuum suction AND the mop cleaning ability are super.- Emptying the dirty water after mopping is a cinch.  (Please DO take care of it.  You wouldn't leave a bucket of dirty water sitting around, waiting to get smelly.)- The unit has a self-clean button.  It is recommended you do this after each use.  It's helpful to run it prior to emptying the dirty water.- At a not too distant point, (and maybe once a month, which is purely my guess) it will be a good idea to take the mop head off and do a thorough cleaning of the mop head area.  This is also very easy.End story - one more rave review to go with the prior thousands of happy purchasers.

  You know that scene in Mrs. Doubtfire with the vacuum? The dancing.. hip shimmies and tippy toe prancing? This baby makes me recreate it everytime.It vacuums. It mops. It self cleans. It has no cord. It. Is. Sexy. It tells you how it feels. Oh, empty clean water tank? Blink blink! Full dirty water tank? Blink blink! Ready for self cleaning? Blinkity blink blink! Sure, cleaning all the parts can take a little bit of TLC but it's worth it. There are no puddles of water, the floors are dry within minutes and it actually cleans. I took a gamble with spending this much money on a fancy mop but guess what? Mopping actually gets done now and isn't that the real goal?

  Update: 6 months later we use this mop vacuum 5+ times a week. Support was AMAZING regarding feedback. Highly responsive. For $400, it works OK. I can’t compare it to the Bissell Crosswave that’s in the $200-$300 range that has tons of positive reviews. Doesn’t get dried up pancakes off the floor (toddler finds.) Does not scrub grout. I wish the brush in this mop was stiffer and bigger to scrub the floor better. The suction pull is surprisingly strong! It’ll pick up the size of sausage crumbles easily. It did clean up dried pomegranate juice off tile floor with ease. You can only use this brands floor cleaner. When the mop is stored after use, even after the self clean mode, it smells like bacteria build up/mildew/dirty wet water. It’s definitely a mop you have to use and completely disassemble, scrub, clean, and set out to dry after EACH use. Definitely a step up from our Shark steam mop. Overall I would recommend it after 6 months of constant use.

  This lasted two months and then it stopped sucking the water back up. My machine is well within the warranty. Tineco said they would send me a new machine and then I could return the broken one back with that box. I went in circles with them for weeks after they never shipped the new machine. Now they’re saying I have to pay for shipping and buy a box through FedEx. They will only reimburse up to $25 but it will cost more than that through FedEx. Company is horrible and the expensive product didn’t even last. Get a Bissell!!

  Bought this for my vinyl laminate floors because vacuuming alone didn’t seem to keep them looking clean (especially this time of year with kids and dogs dragging in mud and snow)!  It works great on the floors - good suction - I do usually have to empty it once if I want to do the whole main level because the clean water canister runs out or the dirty water canister fills up.  It does take some dedication because you will have to clean out the canister / filter after a full floor cleaning!  There is a self cleaning option for the roller brush which is great!Main complaint is it doesn’t get close to walls or the back edge / side of stairs to clean but the suctioning does grab most of the dirt, dog hair, etc!Overall, I love it snd vacuuming is currently fun :)

  It's a great little floor cleaner, good for vacuuming and spot mopping areas in the house. I was able to use it on tile and hardwood with no problems. But to clean all my floors at once was a challenge.My kitchen and dining room are together about 350 Sq ft. Took me several hours to clean because the battery would only last 15-20 minutes, then I had to recharge for 4 or 5 hours. And I probably emptied and filled the tanks a half dozen times.It's a good, lightweight floor cleaner, but for $300 I would've expected better battery life and tanks double the size. This should be priced $100 less.

    Better than the Bissell Crosswave but not self-cleaning
  
","









  
  
    
  I used a BISSELL Crosswave All in One Wet Dry Vacuum Cleaner and Mop for a couple of years, but it was difficult to clean.  This Tineco iFLOOR3 Cordless Wet Dry Vacuum Cleaner is not quite self-cleaning (how could it be?) but it is much easier to clean.  I was amazed at how much dirt Tineco iFLOOR3 cleaned up off of the kitchen floor, just a few days after it had been cleaned by the Bissell Crosswave.  The Tineco model is easier to maneuver than the Bissell.  It has a few eccentricities:  the self-clean light pops on when I'm about halfway through cleaning the floor; the clean water reservoir could be larger--it's easy to pop out, but a bit more difficult to set back in.  However, I'm pretty happy with my iFLOOR3.NOTE:  I've had my Tineco iFLOOR3 for seven months and have used it at least twice a month and for the first time today, I took the roller out to see if it needed to be cleaned.  I found about two cups of pine needles, cat hair, and dirt on and behind the roller.  CLEAN YOUR ROLLER.  IT IS NOT SELF-CLEANING!!!!

  I consider myself an okay house cleaner.  I don't stress about it.  But when I used this new wet dry cleaner I was amazed.  I expected the water that was pulled into the lower small tank to be dirty, but this was discusting.  I had been using the shark steam cleaner and thought my floors to be pretty clean.  I was so wrong.  Now I feel they are so much cleaner.  So this was worth the money and would buy again.  I have a few issues.  One: it is not light weight.  Moving it from one room to another is difficult for me.  I had to take it up and down stairs and I may have to get another machine in the future so I don't have to lug this up and down stairs.  The second issue is emptying and cleaning the tank with the dirty water.  I expected to be able to take the tank off (this was easy) but I had to take the tank and parts out and dump the dirty water.  Then clean the parts.  This is messy process.  I was hoping for an easier clean.  The battery lasted long enough to clean much of my house.  It will depend on if you use the eco option.  It will not last as long on the higher cleaning option.  So, this was not a problem. The cleaner that comes with this, should last a long time.  You add one capful to the clean water tank.  One of my bathrooms has a textured tile floor.  This device was not able to clean into the ridges of the tile.  I have not found anythiing that will clean this tile except on my knees with a stiff brush.

It wouldn’t clean the whole area it went over and when I’d test how clean it was after with a baby wipe it would be just as dirty. This being cordless and easy to charge, AMAZING. I did it in my 3 year old son’s room and holy crap it pulled back so much dirty. The water was disgusting and I did the baby wipe test and it was SPOTLESS.If you’re thinking about getting the bissell bc it’s cheaper, don’t. Get this. It’s so worth spending the extra money.

  I love this machine. My daughter bought it for me for Xmas. She researched every floor cleaning machine. This one had the best rankings for cleaning and ease of use. Purchased a pet friendly competitor machine and it doesn’t compare to the clean that this machine performs. Love it cannot live without it. Had a small issue with it and the company made things right. Got a new machine to replace old one no cost no questions asked. I sing the praises of this unit to everyone I know with children or pets as once you have one you will not be able to live without it ! Promise ! Thank you Tineco for making my house cleaning a breeze 2000 sq ft of wood floors shine like new !

  I absolutely love this unit, makes doing the hard floors so much easier. I still have my other mop to use weekly but this one has become my daily. It makes life so easy not having to sweep and mop or fight with power cords. If you have pets and children or just don't want to spend a lot of time on your floors this is a great purchase. This unit is also easy on the back because it practically pulls itself along.

  You know those people that hate getting a vacuum for Christmas? I am not one of those people. If it is designed to make cleaning feel less like... well... cleaning, I am going to fall for it.I have owned two bissel crosswave vacuums, over two years. I thought it was love. Until I realized that it was only a tired, desperate mom wanting to believe. Crosswave, while lovely and effective, it’s the orange juice in a mimosa. The tomato juice in a Bloody Mary.  The tonic to Tineco’s gin.Tineco is east to assemble, compact, and uses very little water and solution. While I thought “the other one” leaves the floor somewhat dry, the S3 leaves all others under water by comparison. There wasn’t even time for the dogs to run through and visibly ruin my minimal work.Speaking of lack of effort, this is a self propelled wonder. The moment I pushed the power button, I was basically just along for the ride. It’s so easy my kids can do it. They won’t. But they could.I just cleaned my floors yesterday with the BC but today’s dirty water tank was dirtier than a 13 year olds browsing history. The led display had me stop several times when it discovered a spot of extra disgrace. I decided to run a second pass through the living room and the water was nearly clear. Someone on Naked and Afraid definitely would have boiled it and drank it.While the best device would still be a self cleaning house, this new best friend (yes, it even talks to you!) is clearly going to get heavy use for at least the next three months when I remember we do still live here and daily cleaning is only an exercise in futality.

  Really nice vacuum with mop function. It was recommended by one of my friend from my local mommy group. They brought this months ago, and it work wonderful with her toddler who like to throw food and spill drink on the floor.I have been using this for month now, and it does good job cleaning the fresh mess my 1 year-old makes. But just beware don't let the food get fry on the floor, it might be little difficult to get it out.I like that it is cordless so i don't have to drag a cord through the mess. It isn't very heavy and it also self-propelled, which makes it so easy to push around. Just need to teach my daughter how to use it!

  This is the BEST appliance ever - especially because we got a puppy 2 months ago and it's such a lifesaver.  It is easy to use, cleans nicely, has a long charge - I have NO complaints!!!  Get one!!  NOW, a couple things to know:  1. It doesn't  clean corners and close to the baseboard so you have to do a deep mopping and vacuuming every now and again.  2. You have to be willing to empty it and rinse it after every cleaning - it's gross to leave the dirty water in there.  But honestly, this is may be the best appliance I've every purchased!!

    Multiple pet owner loves this mop/vac
  
","









  
  
    
  I’ve only used this twice but I love it. We have a huge house with a ton of laminate. I can do my whole house with one charge including  four bathrooms, kitchen, dining room, living room, toy room, an entry way and laundry room. We have two long hair cats and a big floof of a dog. We also live on a dirt road so our dust level is off the charts. I have a dust mop that we use frequently but this tool is such a time saver and works really well. I use the cleaning solution sent with the machine and do not have an issue with streaks. The only thing that I don’t like is that you can’t get the last inch by the wall. It vacuums it but the mop head can’t reach. I don’t mind taking a rag to the edge every once in a while. So much better than doing it all by hand. It  is very quiet too. I say this is worth every penny.

  I debated for over a year between tineco and bissell crosswave. And then once I decided then I spent forever deciding which model of tineco. I got this one and I am NOT disappointed. I have severe OCD and clean my house constantly everyday. With a dog and two littles, tineco has changed my life. It’s so easy and Convenient and I feel like it does such a great job. We have mainly all hardwood floors and I can get it all done in under 10 minutes. Life changing

  This is amazing. I searched and searched for a vacuum mom combo and I think I am officially in love. We have a robot vacuum that vacuums daily but I was so tired of swiffer mopping every other day. We have two kids and don’t wear shoes in the house but I just used this for the first time in the kitchen and the water was black. I’m a convert and I hope this thing never dies. So excited to have this as my youngest is going to start crawling any day now!!! Whew!!!

  I was going to get the Bissell but after seeing reviews I decided to pay more and get this. I absolutely love it. Cleaning the dirty tank can be gross. Lol the only thing I could complain about is that it stays about an inch away from the wall. So there is an inch that I have to mop every month around things. Not a deal breaker. You will not regret this purchase. I use it on my old wood floor. The floor needs refinished but this thing cleans it well with no damage and hardly any water on the floor so drying time is so fast.

  I tried it right when I received it. This really leaves your floor feeling clean. Not only can you see the dirty water get all sucked up, but you can see the difference between a mop and the Tineco. The only issue is how small both tanks are, and doesnt reach about 1"" away from the baseboards or anything around it. I have to use my stick vac to get into the edges before going in with the Tineco.

  So far I love it! Does great! I love the fact it talks to you & tells you when to fill & needs water, cleaner, needs cleaning & self cleaning mode THE BEST! Only thing is wish tank was bigger for solution. I have pretty big house but keeps charge a long time & can almost do entire house of hardwood floors which is a great deal; I just have to stop & put more solution & water in more times than care to.

  Bought the Floor One S3 to try it and it's been surprisingly good. It can't get really dried stuck on stuff, but it removed stains a plumber created that didn't seem to come off with anything else.One tip is make sure you don't use too much of a foamy soap. We use thieves cleaner but just a little or lots of foam happens.Also don't use it or clean it without the filter installed or too much water comes out and makes a mess. This may only be an issue in this automatic adjusting one.Their video on cleaning is good and true to form. It's easy to clean which means I use it a lot more.

  As someone who has a golden retriever, my floors are always covered with fur and mud.  Before getting this product, I’d carry around a super heavy vacuum and mop while carrying a bucket with me. This product has saved me so much time. It’s so light weight I’m able to take it upstairs. Im able to get all my dogs fur, and if my hair were to get caught up in the roller, I’m able to used the blade they provided in the brush. This is also very easy to clean and I love the self cleaning mode as well.

    Very easy deep cleaning
  
","









  
  
    
  I am convinced my wet swifter sweeper never cleaned my floors. I was disgusted with the dirty water this mop was pulling from my floors. Our floors were so past due for a deep cleaning it’s taking a few times to get them very clean. All the reviews that you see saying it leaves streak marks on the floor is probably because it is very dirty from never been thoroughly cleaned. I had streak marks the first few times and now that they are getting cleaner it does not leave streak marks.

   The Tineco iFLOOR3 is truly a life improving product! We have a 2 year old that is always getting food on the floor, up until now we would get on our hands and knees to wipe up all the fallen food. With the iFLOOR3 we just pick up any large pieces then sweep up the rest. We love this item and wish we would have known about it earlier!

  I have a big Rottweiler that sheds a bit, and drools a lot so I vacuum and mop all the time. With the Tineco its one easy step with the self propelled mode I can do the entire house all in one step! It’s easy to use and very easy to clean just make sure to empty the dirty water tank completely, I left a bit of dirty water in after the self clean mode ran, then I didn’t use it for almost a week, when I did it stunk really bad. I learned my lesson and haven’t had the problem again.

  I don't know why it took me so long to make the decision to buy this.  It's really a God send to me right now as I'm struggling with herniated discs and it's getting harder for me to keep the floors clean with a regular vacuum and a steam mop. The self propel feature is good but I feel my arm being pulled a bit. But everything else outweighs this tiny inconvenience for me.  It's super easy to clean too. Self clean cycle is also very quick. I love it so much.  I will update the review after a few months of use.

  I was skeptical when I first saw this product. However an acquaintance of mine had bought this and had nothing but great things to say. I have a house with a footprint of over 3000 square feet....all wood floors and tile in bathrooms. So it would take me hours to sweep/vacuum the floors then mop. This is a game changer! This product picks up debris amazing (I have a toddler so you can imagine the things dropped on the floor) and mops the floor at the same time....my routine is cut in half.I have a limited number of cons. 1 was a defect in my clean water tank....it had a slow leak in the seam BUT when I contacted the company they were VERY helpful and replaced my tank with no Hassel! Another con is battery life. I cannot clean my whole house on one charge....so I normally split it up and do the bathrooms and bedrooms....charge....and then the kitchen and other living areas. My last con which I would say is more of a suggestion is a larger clean water tank. I have to refill the water and cleaner around 4 times during the process. That isn't a huge deal....but could definitely be an improvement.Overall, I love this product!

   Holy hell!! These were clean floors, or so I thought. I swept, dry mopped, and wet mopped. The video is the first time I gave it a go in my kitchen and after 14 times, it is still not clear!! Gross!!!! This is the hair ball so far it has collected! This has become my obsession for sure. My floors look amazing! The thing cleans itself! It talks to you and shows you when it’s mad because there is a mess.

  The floor 3 is great for quick pickups of spills or to tidy up after cooking.  it works great on loose items.  It is light weight and quieter than a vacuum . I have wood look tile flooring throughout my home .Cons ,don’t clean up to the edges nor does it clean anything stuck on . But my biggest complaint is how it leaves streaks even using the cleaner.  I debated on returning it but when I finally made my decision unfortunately my return had window closed .

    Best mop !
  
","









  
  
    
  I have no word to describe how fast and easy I cleaned  my house with this mop. It took me 1h ( including moving furniture and rugs) to clean 1 floor, two bathrooms and laundry room. Total “vacumoping” time approximately 20 min. I wish charging would take less time, it’s the only negative thing about this mop. I own it for over two weeks. Make sure to buy solution when it gets back in stock. It’s not available for over two weeks.

I will add, I also have a Bissell Crosswave, and I thought that was the best thing since sliced bread, but my Tineco has changed the game. It is simply amazing. I use it for fun!

  There is NO other vacuum with this type of suction, the pieces to put it together have to be just right pr they won't work properly meaning the suction is KEY. The glide is amazing, its as if it helps you push and pull. Once you go cordless there's no going back. The cleaning is so easy, and your not sneezing up a storm cleaning the pieces like a regular vac. It dries quick and actually gets up residue unlike regular mops.

  I only gave it a one star so it would show up for other people. I loved my Tineco when I first purchased it, but a year and one week later the vacuum portion of my Tineco has gone out. So it just pools the cleaning solution on my floors without sucking it back up. I have cleaned the lines and everything I can. The vacuum just never starts up anymore. I have been trying for months to get through to customer service. No one ever answers or responds to my calls. I’m waiting to see if they’ll respond to email, but they haven’t yet. I paid too much money on this product to have I’m not even last two years. Hopefully if I do ever get through to someone, they will uphold their two year warranty….we will see.

  Words can’t describe this vacuum/mop. It’s going to save me so much time. My house 100% will be cleaner because of it. It’s super easy to use and works really well. The suction power is strong and it got up everything! It’s really easy to take apart and clean the parts. I am beyond impressed. The only downfall is you can’t lay it flat to get to the back underneath like an entry way table, and it doesn’t get precisely to the very sides of the baseboard but all the benefits totally outweigh that.

  Holy hell - I had no idea I hated doing floors as much as I did until I bought this thing.  My whole house is hard wood floor and tile, so I've got 1300+ soft of mopping to do on the regular.  The hassle of making a bucket of solution, putting the mop together and then actually doing the cleaning.  This thing you charge up, fill up the clean water tank with a little bit of cleaner and go to town! When the roller gets too nasty, it tells you and you let it clean itself, and right back to cleaning floors.  I did the biggest, nastiest spaces in my house on a half of a charge, and it's amazing how much grime it picked up in just the first pass over the floor.  Highly recommend!

  I have an old, incontinent English Bulldog who can't help but leave messes on the floor.  Up until the time I purchased the Tineco cordless wet-dry vac, I was putting towels over her accidents, running them through the washing machine and spraying Pine Sol on the floor when the towels came up and mopping up the Pine Sol.  It was a production!  A REAL pain!  With this little jewel from Tineco it's vac it up, mop it up  and I'm done.  I can put my towels away and retire the Pine Sol and mop.  My floors are clean, bright and smell good.  Easy Peasy!  Love my Tineco cordless vac-mop!  It works great on tile and linoleum.

  This cleaner was purchased to replace my Bissell Crosswave. I don’t know what I would do without one of these machines. I use it ALOT and my Bissell finally gave out. I saw this alternative and decided to try it out. I was not changing because of cost (honestly I don’t remember if there was or was not a cost difference). This review was written months after purchasing the Tineco.PROS: It seems to remove more dirt than the Bissell. The auto clean function is a plus. It is MUCH quieter than the Bissell. It is cordless and holds a charge for the time I need to clean all my floors.CONS: The cleaning fluid tank is small and has to be refilled often. There is no function that allows me to suck up liquid without the cleaning fluid being dispensed at the same time. The cleaning fluid tank and dirty water tank are a little awkward to fit into the machine.Even though there are more Cons listed than pros I would still recommend this as a great purchase.

    Where have you been all my LIFE?

  I own an Airbnb and on this day my boyfriend was there while I was cleaning my hardwood floor. I was using a traditional mop and dried the floors with an old rag. He said there has to be an easier  way to clean these floors. Mind you I’ve used this method for over 15 years.Soon after I purchased this product and it has been a life, time and lower back saver. The floors dry so fast and free of streaks. Add a few drops of essential oils for a fresh scent cause the solution is odorless. Hurry and buy!

  This vacuum mop model would be amazing if it wasn't constantly leaking. The water dispensers are difficult to pop in.. Also be prepared to clean it thoroughly everyday if you use it often. Hair, and particles will accumulate on the roller and suction area, and turn into sludge with the moisture. This defeats the purpose of it being used to clean. I called customer service and they want me to locate exactly where the leak is coming from before they will assist me.

   Let me just start by saying I do not write reviews often unless I feel really strongly about something. Absolute best purchase I’ve ever made. A huge game changer. This thing does wonders for our floors. The suction power is absolutely amazing. I have a Dalmatian and the amount of dog hair has been overwhelming and nothing has picked it up like the Tineco. I’ve had a Bissell crosswave before and it would just push the wet dog hair around. My floors are shiny after using and feel so clean on our feet! The floors dry quickly too because the Tienco doesn’t soak your floors which is a huge plus when you have laminate flooring. This has saved so much time. I actually enjoy cleaning my floors now.

    Great for a quick clean, but doesn’t replace deep cleaning.

  The tineco is really handy as far as vacuuming and mopping at the same time goes. The suction power is great, but it doesn’t do as good of a job with messes on floors as I would have hoped. I have a toddler that spills food all over our tile floors, and I typically have to mop those spots even after using the tineco. I do enjoy the cordless feature. Handy to have but doesn't do amazing considering the price.

  I bought the Tineco Floor One S3 and it is awesome! The mopping is swell and the self cleaning is magical! I always feel like no matter how much I sweep, as soon as I bring out the mop, a slew of little particles and dust bunnies magically appear - but with this device, it doesn't matter as it just sucks them right up.My son opened the fridge with some force yesterday and a bottle of salad dressing fell out, the lid popped off, and half a bottle of vinaigrette was suddenly emptied across the kitchen floor. I grabbed my new handy dandy Tineco Floor One S3 and darned if it didn't work exactly like the videos showed it would - cleaning up every drop. A real mess became a minor inconvenience.Best part is the time it takes to charge, because it does take a while, but it works for me. Sometimes I get into cleaning mode and just work until I drop. With this device, I clean until it's drained and then I relax, because I have done enough! Great product.

  After hearing rave reviews on this machine at the salon, I bought this for my home.  I had no idea my wood floors were so dirty!  I mean,  I clean and I don't have to dust my feet off to put shoes on....  but I emptied coffee colored water out 3 days in a row!  I loved it so much that I took it to my salon to use,  wondering how it would perform with all of the hair.  Same results!  It is amazing!  The self cleaning function keeps it cleaned and smelling fresh.  It doesn't clog even on the high traffic salon floor.  It has high gloss stained concrete and it never streaks!  It's easy to use and battery lasts long enough to clean the whole building in one charge.  I recommend and demo it to all of my clients!  Love, love, love!

   I recently moved to a cabin in the mountains. We have a gravel driveway and grass leading up to our entry door. We have tile and wood floors throughout the home so I wanted to find a solution to vacuuming and mopping (which takes a lot of time and back-breaking work).After a lot of research and reading reviews, I came across this beauty. This is the first time I've used it and set-up and clean-up were easy with the aid of Tineco videos available on YouTube. I have kept up on dusting and vacuuming the home so I was completely amazed at how much was picked up by this incredible machine! You can see proof of it in the video. YUCK. There was so much sludge at the bottom of the dirty water catcher. The self-cleaning mode is incredible (shown in the video). I took the vacuum through 4 self-cleaning cycles until the water came out clear.The vacuum self-propels. It's easy to use! Our cabin is 1800 sq ft and I got about 3/4 of it done before the cleaner ran out. The vacuum leaves very little water on the floor. I wore socks while ""mopping"" the floor and my socks were hardly wet at the end of the cycle.Amazing machine... time, back, and sanity saver! This is the best purchase ever (2nd to my Instant Pot)!

  I have had my floor one s3 for just over a year now. I have to clean it after every use or it has a horrible smell. It does not clean edges aling walls. For that much money, it should get up against the wall. My swiffer ends up being used more than the tineco. A couple days ago it started making a high pitched winding noise. Customer chat didn't help other than telling me to email customer support. Very frustrated with it.

    Sucks up scorpions!  🦂

  Where do I even begin... this thing is just amazing. My husband got really mad at me that I spent over $400 on a “mop” unit he used it. Our apartment floors stayed sticky, no matter how much I mopped or cleaned (with four kids) it stayed sticky. After one ONE use the floors were no longer sticky!! I use this thing about 7 times a day!  I had to write this review mainly tho bc one day I found a scorpion in the tank! We have a huge problem in our apartment they hide under the fridge and wherever else Here, this things suction is so good, it sucked it up from wherever it was hiding!!!The piece that holds the solution starting leaking though, I’ve emailed tineco about it see what my solutions are . It has a few malfunctions also like it doesn’t tell me when the solution is low anymore, also while charging it randomly stops and starts again like every ten minutes.

  I was super hesitant on purchasing this, not sure if I would get into the habit of using it, but after the first time.  I LOVE IT!!!  I have a few dogs and this works amazing in leaving the floors clean and actually leaves a fresh smell in the room.  Very good quality.  The only CONS were that it does not get under the couch or in corners at all.  It also takes awhile to go through the final clean cycle when you are finished but overall I can handle that easily.  My mopping and vacuuming overall time cut down into a third of the time!!!  Wish I would have bought it sooner!  I can't live without it!!!!

    Disappointing
  
","









  
  
    
  I am so disappointed in this vacuum. For the price, the self cleaning method should actually clean the vacuum’s inner piping. Every time I open up the dirty water tank I have to pick it up and put the vacuum in my sink and run water through the pipe that runs from the tank to the underside of the vacuum. Dirt and hair gets clogged in there. The roller brush gets musty and smells awful unless you remove it from the vacuum and scrub it in the sink with soap and water EVERY TIME. It does not end up saving any time. If you use it like you’d use a cordless vacuum (take it off the charger, go straight into cleaning, put it back on the charger when you’re done) the smell the next time you use it is awful. Even if you run self cleaning mode and empty the water tanks each time you use it, it will still smell awful the next use because of the clogging of the pipe and underside.For the way it cleans and works, it’s decent but 100% not worth the money. I’m going to contact tineco about refunding.

  This thing is only good for spot cleaning. The vacuum doesn't touch the sides of the wall so expect missed spots. Continually been having issues each time of it not working. Most days it broken and doesn't suck up anything. It just leaves puddles behind no matter how you try to follow troubleshooting instructions. Some days it works other it doesn't. Called customer service and theu did fix the problem after shipping back to them for repair. But now the part in the dirt tank is broken. And only one place to buy it and thats on tineco website but they are always out of stock. This is complete trash and isn't worth the money at all

  I love my Tineco. This is things I’d definitely worth the money! This is a lot so I hope you have a few minutes.PROS1. Uses separate tanks for clean and dirty water.2. Motor “Pulling” technology so no pushing around and won’t hurt your back.3. Lightweight. 8-9.5 lbs give or take.4. SELF CLEANING!!! To reassure you’re using a clean mop everytime all you have to do is dock it and press a button.5. Charging/home station. Set it up wherever you want (near outlet)And it stays/charges/cleans itself in the home station.6. Set-up is easy7. Has a digital display that tells you when to self clean/ if something is tangled/ dirty water full/ clean water empty /battery low or full8. Comes with cleaner brush, cleaning solution and extra filter and all the filter needs is rinsing and drying. The newer series also comes with an extra roller brush.9. Oh best of alllll it’s mops and vacuums at the same time!CONS1. Kinda loud (less than a regular vacuum just louder than I expected I guess) when it cleans itself but it’s like a 2-4 min process2. Only 25min charge Time but unless you have a huge house it’s not a problem3. A bit pricey lol $299 for the one I have $399 for the newer series. The newer series talks to you and has like 5 min longer battery time. A pretty penny but I believe it’s worth it.4. When you go to rinse the dirty water tank out (can use a few times til) you have to rinse the filter and it takes 24hr to dry buttttt you get an extra to use.5. Repetitive cleaning with the dirty water tank is a little annoying.The BIGGEST CON for me but I was fully aware when I bought.I’d love if I could click a button or remove the roller brush or something that would allow me to ALSO vacuum my carpets. Now I know this isn’t the purpose for the machine. It is a 2 in 1 mop vac! But I think this would make it a top selling cleaning product if it did. I do love my tineco though.10/10 would def recommend.

  This is phenomenal!!! My house is all laminate and it would take me hours to mop, and I DREADED it. Now, I don’t dread it at all, and I can mop the entire house in 1/10 of the time! I have three dogs and use it daily, for little accidents, big accidents, or whole house cleaning. This was very handy when I recently cleaned and scrubbed my bathroom floor tile grout with a scrub brush then used the Tineco to mop up all the residue. Saw several comparisons on Tiktok and Facebook comparing this machine to the Bissell that everyones raving about and the Tineco beat it each and every time. Favorite part is when I set it on the base and it cleans itself. Now all of our adult children want one for Christmas, so it looks like we will be buying at least three more!

  I bought this due to having a white German Shepherd who sheds constantly and a senior cat who pees on the floor because of her declining health.PROS: perfect for daily cleaning of my hardwood floors! I love that I can finally clean my floors in just one step instead of vacuuming and then moping. It used to take FOREVER especially with all the white turfs of hair everywhere. We also love it for deep cleaning the area our cat pees at after we clean up and spray the area. It also does great picking up cat litter! I love how it’s self cleaning and that it has a charging station. My fiancé and I both say it’s one of our best purchases!! Saves so much time and keeps our floors clean. The “Max” mode is great for picking up stuck on items and spills. The display on top is great too, it tell you when the dirty water tank is full, the cleaner tank is empty, when it needs to be self-cleaned, etc.CONS/Areas that could use improvement: it can’t pick up too much hair at the same time or it gets caught in the wet roll brush and I have to manually unclog it. But, it’s pretty easy, you just pop the guard off and pull it out. Also if you have fur babies you’ll have to self-clean it a lot if you don’t vacuum daily. I also wish it could get closer to the edge when cleaning against walls/items but I saw the more expensive version does but I couldn’t afford the extra $100 it costs for that and voice command.Overall, I love it and consider it one of my best adult purchases!

    Broke twice

  It’s not worth the money. Great concept but made in China so it’s crap. First one broke just after 30 days and was able to replace through Amazon. Replacement unit just stopped working. Similar complaint to others. Emailing someone in China to try and get replaced is just not worth the hassle. When it did work it worked well but for 300 dollars it’s should last longer. To be honest none of these wet dry vacuums really last or work long term. Best option for cleaning hardwood floors is a steam mop. Just vacuum and then steam.Very disappointed that I spent 300 dollars went through 2 units and barely got a full year out of both units. 30 Amazon warranty is useless and company warranty is just too difficult to try and obtain.

  This vacuum mop cleans very well. My only issue is that there is not enough cleaning solution to do a good amount of floor. Plenty of battery, not enough cleaning solution. The basic steps are: fill vacuum with cleaning solution, clean floors for 10 mins till it runs out, empty waste container, fill back cleaning solution, auto clean the rollers, empty the waste container again, fill the solution container again, continue cleaning floor for another 10 mins, repeat until floor is clean. Drives me crazy how many times I have no fill and empty the solution and waste container.Floors do be looking clean tho.

  We are a military family and we live in base housing. IYKYKWe could not get our vinyl floors clean to save our life. I caved and bought the Tineco during cyber Monday. This did not disappoint!! The black water that came up from my floor was absolutely disgusting. This machine definitely does it’s job. 10/10 recommend this product. The self cleaning and robot talking is a huge plus. I didn’t even know those were a thing until it came and I put it together. I will say, do NOT forget to empty the dirty water tank and rinse the roller. It will smell awful if you forget to leave it overnight. It is super easy to empty and rinse out. This product is super user friendly. Worth spending the extra money for a good product.

  I don't generally write reviews for stuff but I have to rave about the Tineco S3.  It is obviously very well made and actually as stylish as a cleaning appliance can be I suppose.  (i.e. wouldn't be out of place next to a Dyson) There was no complicated setup--just install the handle, take off some of the packing material, charge the cleaner, and fill it up with the water/cleaner mix.  I'm kind of one of those ""don't read the instructions"" kind of guys and all of it came together intuitively.  In use, it is very easy to maneuver and barely any water residue remains after going over areas.  This thing cleans very well too--just did a quick once over of our floors and the resultant dirty water tank was practically black.The only real negatives I can think of is that the voice is LOUD and I couldn't quite figure out how to shut it up until I installed the app and turned off the voice.  Also, there is some maintenance to it but it's nothing unreasonable for what it does.  My understanding the maintenance tasks are probably quicker to do than the Bissell Crosswave Max, for instance, so it's not really a criticism, just something you should expect as a user.  They do provide a spare filter and spare roller mop, so you can let the one you used dry out while installing a new clean, dry one.All in all, it's a very well thought out product and something we hope to use for a long time to come.

I have four young children, a dog, and a cat. My floors are seriously never clean, enter in Tineco wet/dry vac! This is the first product of its kind I have personally purchased so I cannot attest to how it holds up against other similar vacuums but for everyday cleaning it is great!Pros:Very easy to useCleans my floors quickly - I have tried lots of other swiffers, microfiber mops, etc etc and everything would leave streaks. This is the first mop that makes my floors feel clean on my feet.Uses a small amount of cleaning solutionSelf cleans RollerCons:MUST clean dirty water tank each time*Note, if you do not want a mop where you have to dump the dirty water tank and clean hair out of tube between the roller and the water tank. This is not the product for you. I don't mind as it cleans my floors in under 30 minutes and takes about 5 mins to clean everything after each use.

  I just recieved this Tineco iFLOOR3 yesterday. It was packaged really well, and was simple to assemble. It has a little bit of charge right out of the box and I was able to get my office and living room floors clean before it ran out of charge. THIS THING IS AMAZING!  It only took about 10 minutes to do those 2 rooms(and the hallway in between). It picked up ALL of the dog hair, popcorn kernels(which my upright vacuum would never pick up) and mopped the floors at the same time. The floors feel cleaner than they have in a long time. My upright vacuum didn't work well on hard floors, so I had to sweep with a broom and dust pan, then I would have to mop with my steam mop. This would take me a couple of hours to do just the main rooms in the house. With the iFLOOR3 it will cut that down to 30 minutes to an hour. I will update after I have had the vacuum for a longer amount of time so I can tell how it holds up.

  Best purchase in a long time.  In the last month we finished our remodel which now has most of our home covered in hard surface floors now, not to mention a new puppy which now means with the spring weather double the muddy floors.  I ordered the item below a week ago but was debating on sending it back because it was cordless which is great but it only holds a 25 minute charge and last time I did the floors on the main level it took me a couple hours with all the sweeping and mopping.  Well guess what with this machine I got all the floors done in less than 25 minutes and it was so darn easy.  It vacuums and mops at the same time so you only go over the floor once,  it uses minimal cleaner, floors are dry almost immediately, it is self propelled all you have to do is steer the thing and pull it back, and to top it all off the crazy product even cleans itself.  No cleaning pads needed, no cleaner to spray, no mop and bucket.  Worth every penny and such a time saver.

  This is a wonderful machine until it stops working.  I have now ordered two of these.  Both had to be returned after being used less than 3 days.

  So I’ve been eyeing this baby out for MONTHS.  Never in stock my sisters tried to buy me the Bissell for my birthday but I said no I didn’t want this one..  well last week my friend had it on her Snapchat and totally convinced me to get it, 2 days later it was back on Amazon..  SOLD bought it right away...  Friday it comes, get home from dinner and finally open it, try it on the floors 😍 well today I deep cleaned my house couldn’t wait to try it, (didn’t mop them all week knowing it was coming)..  LET ME TELL YOU.  TOTALLY WORTH THE MONEY.  SPOTLESS!!! ( And I did the wipe test after) 10000000000% HIGHLY RECOMMEND

  This is a godsend! I'm a loyal Tineco vaccum and Brevill Steam mop user.  This, however, is making those obsolete.  Does it do as good of a job as the steam mop?  No, but it's pretty close.  And, it's all one step.  And, it's cordless.  And it's less clean up.  So, it takes me 15 min max to do my whole house.  Even doing it once a week, that keeps my floors perfectly clean.  It's fun though, so I'll probably do it twice a week, so they stay clean.  I also love that I can use it on Pergo - before I would just vacuum and spot clean.  If you like a clean house and you don't mind cleaning regularly, this is a must have!

  I absolutely love the Tineco Floor One S3!!! All the floors in our house are luxury vinyl plank & this does an amazing job cleaning them! I can vacuum & mop my whole house in a fraction of the time it used to take. It gets floors so much cleaner than anything I’ve tried before. I love the red/blue dirt indicator ring & I also love that it talks to you. This has definitely been a game changer for me cleaning my floors!!

  Who likes to mop with a regular mop & bucket anyway!? This is a great alternative! I let my sister borrow it, and she wants one now. Your floors may LOOK clean, but trust me -- once you use this the first time, you'll be shocked how much it picks up. We have three dogs, so this product is a life saver. Although it also vacuums, I generally run our robo-vac before using Tineco just to make it a little easier.

  I bought this cleaner because we have three toy dogs and was looking for a way to keep puppy paws off of a dark floor.  I don't use it to suck up large messes like some but it it absolutely perfect for puppy paw prints.  My floors are gorgeous and I love that it self cleans and is self propelled.  Now I can do a quick clean up on my entire house in 1/2 the time of sweeping and then mopping.

  The vacuum does it’s job extremely well and we’re very happy with it…but it seems to leak clean water from the reservoir, ever so slightly. The slow leak allows water to get into the filter compartment, which is a big no-no.We returned the leaky product and got a replacement, but that one leaks too! Now we’re going to return the 2nd one and are considering trying the newer model, or just a new company. Ugh. I wish it didn’t leak because it’d be an amazing product…

  I love this for a quick spill clean-up or for when I start to notice dog fur dust bunnies. It can leave some streaking until the brush is completely saturated. This dries very quickly and seems to be doing a great job. I don't like the smell of the cleaner that Tineco sends with this but it fades quickly. I think this was worth every penny simply for the time it has saved me alone. I would very much recommend if you are clumsy or have pets (I don't have kids so I can't speak to the disasters that they create).

  The Tineco Vacuum mop is amazing machine. It's easy to use and cuts down on cleaning time. It took a two step process down to one. Tineco is light weight and easy to lift and move to different levels of your house. Its easy to clean.

  I was between this one and the Bissell crosswave pet vacuum. My cousin bought the Bissell and I bough this one. After 1 month Hers has a bunch of issues, and she doesn’t even have a pet.I have a dog that sheds like crazy and this vacuum sucks up all the hair, and never gets clogged.Yes you have to clean the vacuum after ever use, but it’s not a lot of work. It’s better than dealing with a dirty gross mop.I have hard large tiles throughout my house and it cleans them very well.I can clean my entire 2,200 sq ft home on 1 full battery.Zero complaints about this vacuum. (Not sponsored, but I should be lol)

  Very disappointed on the limited amount of  time I have to clean the tiled floors will take me days to finish. I have a 3,000sq ft home fully tiled I had to recharged three times. Also, it is a surface cleaner, you can't go under  a table, bed or any furniture it will shut off. As far as performance it cleans excellent. Definitely not worth $400.00 for surface cleaning.

  LOVE this product! It has been a game changer in my house. We have 3 boys and a large dog, it quickly and easily takes care of everyday messes. Huge time saver that I don't have to vacuum before I mop. I bought a second set of roller bars so I can let them dry out in between uses, and still have a clean dry set ready to go when the next mess happens. Since seeing how well mine works, my mother-in-law, sister in law's, and best friends have all bought one. Only downside is it leaves about a 1 inch gap by the baseboards that doesn't get mopped. It still sucks up the crumbs and dirt, just can't reach it with the mop. Which to me is minor, I just take my old swifter to the edges. I use the eco mode on my wood floors and use the higher speed on my tile. It's super easy to use, my 5&7 year olds use it and change the filter and roller bars themselves.  Definitely worth the money!!

  I was SO excited that I was able to score one of these babies since it had been sold out for as long as I had been looking for one but when it arrived, it was very obviously used! So recently that there was still water in the clean water tank. It was disgusting! No where in the description did it say anything about it being a used model, I paid FULL PRICE and it was missing the 3 in 1 cleaning tool. To say I am disappointed is an understatement. But because it was so hard to get my hands on, I cleaned it and tried it out and was very impressed with how well it cleans. I have 4 boys, a German Shepard, a Lab and a lot of wood floors and this has been a life saver!

    Best Floor Cleaner I have ever purchased
  
","









  
  
    
  I own just about every floor cleaner out there because I have pergo wood floors and had the hardest time keeping them clean. Not any more.  This Tineco is Amazing! It is self propelled like a lawnmower,  it gets under cabinets and even around the toilet.  It monitors and cleans itself as well. Not to mention that it isn't as loud as others.So when it arrived, I decided to try it out on my already clean floor that I had used my steam cleaner on. Well, I enclosed a picture of ALL of the hair and grime it sucked up out of what I thought was a clean floor. My floors look and feel the cleanest they have ever been and the biggest bonus is no flim and streaks that all products usually leave. Anyone with pergo floors should know what I am talking about.

  I’ve had the Tineco S3 for a few weeks now and it’s been a great addition to our home - it cuts down on floor cleaning time and the amount of energy I usually spend on the floors. However, it has its issues which (in my opinion) does not allow it to live up to its $400 price tag. I live in a 1200 sqft apartment in NYC and have two dogs. One of my dogs has pretty fine hair which apparently doesn’t work too well with this vacuum. As soon as that fur gets wet, it sticks to the floor and it takes quite a few passes to suck it up into the vacuum. The vacuum would also be annoying to have in a large home. The water tank has barely just enough space to clean my top floor. Then I have to refill, self clean and empty the dirty water tank before I can move on to the second floor and then repeat the process. The maintenance of the vacuum has become another chore in itself. I would actually have actually loved its self cleaning mechanisms if I didn’t have to do it ~3 times every use. Overall, it is an upgrade from my old routine but I definitely would not buy it at full price if I had to do it again.

  The Tineco Floor One S3 is WAY overpriced! I expected a whole lot more for $400 bucks. The machine works ok on messes that are not dried and sticky. It doesn’t clean sticky messes. It does clean very close to the baseboards either. The water tanks are too small as well. I have to constantly keep emptying and filling the tanks. The roller is too soft, it should have some stiff bristles mixed in with the soft material. The digital features are nice but it will not connect to my phone so the app is useless. I will keep this unit because I don’t want the hassle of sending it back. But if I were you I would buy the cheaper Tineco model not the $400.00 one.

  Just got this after liking my S12 vac for the better part of a year.Wow! I’m SO impressed!!Easy set up, easy to use, and almost cleans itself! (Depending on how dirty your floors are, you’ll have to do some final rinsing and such.)We’ve been in our new home for six months (three large dogs) and have mostly grass now with a little exposed dirt.  I’ve been dry and wet mopping several times a week and thought I was getting the dirt up but it was back breaking work since we have hard floors with area rugs.  So, I finally broke down and spent the money.Pictures don’t lie.  Not sure they do justice to what this machine picked up!  I dust mopped fur and dirt FIRST!  But, the second pic shows even more fur this machine picked up!!  It took three tanks and 80% battery to wash about 2,000 sf.  The dirty water was a slurry of mud and fur!  Inspected the roller after and thought it was pretty clean but when I ran the clean cycle, that water was almost as disgusting!!  Now, the floors LOOK and FEEL SO CLEAN!!!Only one capful for cleaner is added per clean water tank.  No Streaking!  Floors dried in less than five minutes!!WILL update.

It is a quiet, lightweight, and easily maneuverable vacuum to get those tight places. It will transition easily to low, small area rugs, vacuum them well, and transition back to hardwood without missing a beat. The battery life isn’t phenomenal, but it’ll get my whole house done in a single charge. The best thing that sets this apart is the ability to detect and work with wet messes as you would dry messes. It has app and self cleaning function with it. The dual function with medium size cleaning tank saves the need for multiple devices. Overall I am impressed with the vacuum. Its not perfect, but sweeps well, mops, and is cordless which is a win in my book.

    O-Cedar Mop better value, or Steam Mop

  First off, like SO MANY OTHERS, I read the negative reviews and the positive ones.Positive:1)  It does clean the areas it can't reach. It does have a sleek design.Negative:1)  How are you going to use this behind the toilets? It won't fit.2) The roller will always leave an inch gap against the walls, where it will not clean. It's annoying to see that inch of just dirt. (I'm not paying $300, to use a microfiber cloth to make up for that)3) I don't need another app on my phone to operate a mop I have to push myself. If this was a vacuum self robot, then I understand the app idea.4) THIS IS THE BIGGEST ONE - You need at least a 10% charge to remain at the end of your mopping in order for the self cleaning to work. The charging takes FOREVER just for 10%. So, imagine this, you mop the areas you need, and you're assuming it's going to be 30min of a job right? Well....if you get below 10%, you're going to have to wait about 30minutes for the battery to charge past 10% for self cleaning to work. I don't know about you, but I want a machine that cuts down on time.5) I got the O-Cedar Mop, that thing is 30 times better, so is any steam mop that is around $1006) I did email Tineco customer support, and they could not give me a straight answer, they wanted me to send them a video with the problem - 3 days later. By then, the Tineco mop was already being sent back with UPS and Amazon had already issued a refund.

  I had previously purchased the Bissell CrossWave® Cordless Max Multi-Surface Wet Dry Vac which is similar to this Tineco iFloor3.  The Bissell CrossWave® Cordless Max was horrible and I returned it after using it one time.  Because of that experience, I was very hesitant to order this Tineco iFloor3. But I've ended up with my arm in a cast for 10 weeks and really needed something since my little Swiffer push stick mop was almost impossible for me to use.So I took a chance and ordered this Tineco iFloor3 and used it for the first time today. Wow, I'm extremely impressed! The Tineco iFloor3 is very lightweight and highly maneuverable which is very important to me right now since I am down to one hand/arm for a couple of months.  I could easily push it around our extensive footage of hard floors with one hand and it did an excellent job cleaning, better than I can do with just the little Swiffer stick wet mop pads.  Plus it was fast! I did not have to go very slowly in order for it to clean well; basically as quickly as I could push it, it would clean the floor well, particularly on the Max setting.The battery life also surprised me. I cannot vacuum both my sunroom and kitchen with my Bissel cordless vacuum without running out of battery power before I can finish the 2 rooms. With this Tineco iFloor3, I was able to wash the floors of both the sunroom and kitchen, laundry room, and powder room and still had charge left.  Definitely impressive and a very nice surprise!I was skeptical about both the floor cleaning solution that comes with this Tineco iFloor3 and the self-cleaning cycle but I am pleased with both. I usually prefer to use simply water with vinegar and alcohol for my floor cleaning solution to avoid streaks, but just using water and the Tineco solution did a good job cleaning without leaving streaks so I’m happy with it. Also, the self-cleaning cycle was easy to use and did a great job. I took the roller out and washed it under running water after the self-cleaning cycle just in case, but the roller was already very clean from the self-cleaning cycle.As always, there are a few cons. You cannot tip it flat to get under chairs/tables and it does not fit under the toe-kick in my kitchen.  But the pluses of this Tineco iFloor3 far outweigh its cons, so I can live with having to touch up underneath those areas with the Swiffer stick mop pads .  It would also be nice if the clean and dirty water tanks were a little bit larger so you can go longer without having to refill the clean water tank and empty the dirty water tank, but of course that would increase the weight and decrease the maneuverability so maybe if I had to choose, I would stay with these smaller water tanks so that the weight stays lighter.Overall, at this time I highly recommend the Tineco iFloor3.  Time will tell how long it last before having problems at which time I will find out how Tineco’s customer service is, but with first use I’m very pleased with this floor washing unit and hope it will remain trouble free for a long time.

  It is okay machine, had very high expectations. Does not clean tough mess also does not remove any marker marks ect. I hand wash the floors once a week & even i do the better job than this machine. Cleaning the floors with it is very time consuming & sometimes need to go over some places 2-3 times. Also charging takes too long & i have to wait hours before i can finish the job. Might be good for small places.Edit: after using it maybe 5 times it leave water marks everywhere & sprays more water than usual.

    Great cleaning product but, misses the mark due to design flaws
  
","









  
  
    
  I WAS really excited to get this product after reading the reviews on this site and others, it seemed like it was everything I wanted...Pros:1. It does provides a deep cleaning compared to a mop or disposable pad cleaning devices. I cleaned my floors before hand and then used the this product to see if it cleaned more which it did. I was actually really impressed and disgusted at the same time with how well it cleaned the floors.  I do recommend it for deep cleaning purposes (in addition to a mop).2. The vacuum suction is great as well.Cons:1. As stated in the description the average battery life is 18-23 minutes however, this is not sufficient time to clean any room. 18 minutes for max cleaning and 23 for eco cleaning. But, who wants to use the eco function?!?2. It takes 4 hours between each full use to be able to use again for another 20 minutes. 90% of my house is tile and after 2 full days I’m only 50% finished cleaning my house.3. Within 5-7 minutes the self cleaning icon starts to flash, meaning you need to place it on it’s charging base to clean the roller, otherwise it will just spread the dirt accumulated on the roller across your floor. Mind you it does not charge during this process so it’s reduces the battery life and the time that you have available to clean your floors.4. There is a major design flaw! This is not edge to edge (front to back or side to side) it will not clean near a baseboard or any other object within approximately 1 inch regardless of you approach the area head on or from the side (see photo).5. It does not clean the grout very well between tile. Nor does it buff out scuff marks or caked on dirty area (even with multiple passes).Overall: I think that this device does a great job of cleaning the hard surfaces after you mop the floors. However this will not replace your mop or other clean interior tools. The battery life is not efficient to clean your house in 1 day. For the price point you are better off buying a wet/dry mop that is corded, in ordered to clean your entire house.

I've emailed multiple times to the email they tell you and it gets returned as undeliverable. I've attempted to send a request through the app and it tells you there's a data connection problem. I need to get replacement accessories with my warranty or a return or whatever, but the company is completely irresponsible and non-responsive.

    Less cleaning time and much less effort
  
","









  
  
    
  I used to vacuum the floor and then mop it using a Bissell steam mop, the result is good but it demands effort and besides that if the floor is too dirty the steam mop acts just like a normal mop that really doesn't pick up all the grime. Now that I have been at home because of the quarantine I have had time to search the Internet for better options, I decided to buy the Bissell CrossWave Cordless Max Multi-Surface, I placed the order but later I received a response message that that model was out of stock, since I had already made the decision to buy I then moved to Tineco, which was my second option, and how happy I feel because of that. This machine really rocks. At the beginning I was getting streaking on the floor but I realized that it happened because the floor was too dirty for the machine to clean it completely on the first pass, the result I got later after two or three more uses is just incredible, our ceramic floor has never been so clean and with so little effort.As other review says once the floor is cleaned, it's just maintenance what is needed, the cleaning time is reduced and also the battery and the cleaning water solution last longer because the machine automatically adjust the cleaning power that is needed according to how dirty is the water that is being suctioned up. I'm so glad with Tineco that I now want to buy one of the Tineco vacuum sticks but I'm waiting for a discount or good offer.I'm trying now to clean the grout on my floor, the first attempt this morning was to apply grout cleaner directly on the floor and let it stay for a while before using the Tineco machine to pick up the dirt. The result is quit good.07/01/2020As some reviewers mention the machine is not able to clean the floor closer than 1 inch to the wall (actually on the right side the unclean strip is around 1"" and on the left side is about 1.5"" see my picture). There is a Karcher FC5 machine capable to clean right to the edge but the cleaning roller is split by half and the video reviews on YouTube show that the final performance is not good. I consider this as a minor limitation on the Tineco machine since the overall performance  is fantastic.10/28/20 FIRST PROBLEMAfter only five months of usage the Tineco Floor One S3 has started to not charging the battery or even though the battery appears to be 100% charged the charge doesn't last the same as before. I found out that the problem may be due to a corrosion on the electrical contacts that connect the appliance to the charging base (see the picture), which looks to me like a design flaw since on the base that part is covered by a flap and on the Floor One contacts seems to be not exposed to humidity.  I cleaned the contacts the best I could with a scotch brite pad but would like to find a better solution for the problem.

  Overall it is a great product. It can deal with light stains pretty well, and it saves lots of efforts because it is propelled by itself. To deal with tough stains, you really need to turn on the max power, which will consume the water in the tank really fast. Also, this does not deal with light ashes very well - you may think the light ashes are gone when the floor is wet, but when the floor dries up, you will start to spot the light ashes again.

  Not worth the money. If you’re one of those OCD cleaners like myself that has to make sure to get every crease and spot in the house this is not it. Not worth the money. Doesn’t get in the corners so you have to sweep the creases out first and then use a different mop to get the corners and edges of baseboards. Swiffer does a better job at getting the creases and corners.

  I love that it cleans 10x better than a mop but for the price I wish the battery would last longer than just 20 min and the water tank was a bit bigger to reduce the number of times I have to go empty it . Overall good buy just a bit pricey.

  I looove my tineco. It’s so useful for quick cleaning and low spoon days. My fiancé mops one week and I use the tineco the next week. It hasn’t replaced normal sweeping/mopping for us because there’s some stuff it just doesn’t pick up. I recommend using the max power setting as opposed to the eco setting that’s already activated when you turn it on. The only bad thing is having to clean it super well when you are done using it. Be sure to clean it right away, if you leave it sit for a couple hours the brush starts to smell. I am surprised at how long the little bottle I was sent when I bought it has lasted. I’m getting ready to order a new bottle soon just so I don’t run out but I’m sure I still have a couple months worth after using it once a week. We do the hallway, kitchen, closet and bathroom.

  I have had 2 bissell crosswaves before purchasing this.  Both of my crosswaves quit working at the 1 year mark.  I always cleaned them after every use.So, I decided to try something different. I am so thankful I did.  This machine is a mom's dream.  Quickly clean up spills and vacuum and mop the hard floors.  It is lighter than the bissell, quiter and does a better job.  Plus, it is cordless.  The cordless bissell is way more expensive.Mom's and busy people everywhere,  you need this in your home.

  I originally purchased the Tineco iFloor thinking that I didn’t need the top notch floor cleaner as I was mainly just looking for something to clean up my dogs accidents. What a turd burger that thing was. It would suck up the mess but I could never tell if I was spraying cleaner or not. Half the time I felt like I was just spreading the mess around. Th floor one S3 was on sale for prime day so I figured I’d give Tineco one more shot and wow. Night and day. This thing sprays the cleaner all by itself, it’s self propelled, it leaves minimal moisture behind, kind of separates debris from dirty water and the floors are spot less. The self clean cycle is also pretty impressive as well. I have all sealed concrete floors and it really just does an amazing job for normal cleaning as well as pet accidents. I would definitely recommend this product. Spend the extra money for this one and avoid the base model iFloor.

I normally wash the floors once a week cause it would take me so long, I just did the entire house and 3 bathroom in less than 30 min!  Great thing about it is I do t have to vacuum first, it will s incorporated into the system!  I love it!  The only thing I would say is the clean water tank is pretty small, I had to refill half way through, but all in all I’d highly recommend!  Can’t wait to use it again!

  I love this, I would have given it a 4-5 star review, but it broke down today after not even a year of having it. I tried to self clean, it leaked everywhere and told me to restart or contact customer support. After trying to use it without self cleaning, it told me the dirty water tank was full. It wasn’t. The app told me there was a motor malfunction. I’m upset because I would use it everyday, sometimes twice a day after letting my dog back into the house. It was super easy to use, and I would take very good care of it and thoroughly clean it out after every single use and would do a soak in with everything in the tub once every other week. I would deep clean with a real mop once every two to three weeks and the water would barely be dirty because I maintained my floors with this. Not sure how I’m going to maintain my floors now. Waiting on a response from the tineco team about the malfunction.

  For starters, it’s not a very thorough clean.. going alongside the walls 2 inches next the wall and it won’t clean - doesn’t even touch it. “Max” mode doesn’t do any better of a job than regular mode. You have to refill and empty 4-5x to do a 500 sq ft area. We’ve used ours 5-6x in a year bc it’s just Meh compared to a certain spin mop in half the time. Not only is it meh, and how little use we got out of it (yes I say got bc the motor is trash) .. went to run a self clean on it and it repeats “restart or contact customer service” - go to the app, and app says the motor has failed… Really?! 5-6 uses and the motor died already. Just very very unimpressive for $399

    Cleans easy messes, but with a tradeoff. Not good for stuck-on stuff.
  
","









  
  
    
  I have had the Tineco iFloor3 for about a year and a half now. At first, I was blown away. I loved that I could pick up all the dirt and mop at the same time. But after over a year, here is what I've noticed:1) It does not pick up stuck-on messes. This is the make-or-break for me. I have 2 young children, so there is always food on the floor. I found that no matter how many times I went over most stuck-on messes, the Tineco did not get them up. And you can't put more pressure into it like a traditional mop to get those messes up. The steam mop did a much better job. For how expensive this machine is, and the maintenance it requires, I don't want to have to keep another machine around to fully clean.2) You have to clean it out after every single use. Even if I just run it for a minute under the table, I then have to spend a minute washing out the dirty water tank in the sink. I've found that if I leave the dirty water in there, even for the day, it starts to smell and get gross. So you really need to at least rinse it out. You need to run the self-clean after every couple of uses too, which means remembering to come back and empty the tank again. So, while it may save you time on the floor, it adds time afterward for maintaining the machine.  On that note, I don't necessarily think it's cleaner than something like a steam mop. Even though it puts dirty water in a separate tank, I've tested out how many times I have to run self-clean to get clean water coming through. I've run it three times in a row, and the water coming into the dirty water tank is still not completely clean, so the dirt that you pick up stays in some parts of the machine, like the brush. Unless you're going to deep clean the brush and all parts of the machine regularly (a hassle), then it's probably not any cleaner than other forms of mopping (unless you're just straight-up dunking a regular mop in dirty water).3) I still swept before running the machine. It can pick up bigger pieces of food, but it creates more of a mess in the tank to clean afterward, and I felt it was easier to just sweep in the interest of not washing those pieces out of the dirty water tank. Combine that with the fact that I still had to run the steam mop every few days to get stuck-on stuff, and it wasn't really saving me time. I've found that sweeping with a broom, then running the vacuum daily works just as well.If you have a large area of hard floor to clean, and it is mostly minor dirt like paw prints (not sticky, stuck-on food), then this could be a great machine for you. For me, I have a small area to clean most days, and it is a lot of food mess. So I found it was easier to simply sweep and vacuum daily, then run the steam mop every couple of days.

    Not working properly out of the box
  
","









  
  
    
  I was very optimistic about this unit after reading many of the positive reviews. However, my unit did not function properly out of the box. The problems I had were as follows:• When using Auto mode, the ‘dirty water tank is full’ prompt would trigger when the tank was only about 25% full. When using Max power mode, this did not seem to be an issue.• The ‘clean water tank is empty’ prompt would trigger when it still had about 25% water left.• The self-clean cycle never successfully completed a full cycle.• Occasionally, the device stopped and prompted me to restart it or call customer service.I had this product for a grand total of two days and did not even get the chance to remove the plastic screen protector. When it was working, it pulled a lot of dirt up off my vinyl plank flooring, which makes it even more disappointing that I have to return this unit. It seems like the mop is a great idea with poor execution.

  I bought this after seeing great reviews on tik Tok. The first one I received was broken. Although I wasn't even sure if I just wasn't using it correctly since there were no instructional videos on YouTube or anywhere else. I contacted the customer service they were very apologetic and offered to refund me or to send a new one. I received my new one and it worked amazing I have a small house and three kids and it's perfect for everyday cleaning. It doesn't get out things that are stuck to the floor obviously so I just make it lose with my nails or whatever I have and it picks it all up it's really great. I do think it's the price is worth it even though I hate cleaning it but I don't have to slave over a mop or be on all fours so I absolutely adore this product. I do think the price is very high for this vacuum. I have no doubt that in 5 years they're going to come out with something much more amazing and the price for this vacuum is going to go down.

  So I was a little nervous being that I have five kids and two big dogs, but I was beyond impressed. I love the fact that it can detect when the floor is a little dirtier and it kicks into higher speed without you even having to do anything. It is super easy to maneuver and it pretty much pulls itself forward. It is absolutely the best thing and I am so glad that I went ahead and purchased it even though I was nervous because the price is a little high for my pockets. If you’re hesitant about doing it I’m telling you it is the best I cleaned my entire house in minutes and it normally takes me hours. In the instructions it said that it has a 35 minute battery life but I’m telling y’all I clean my entire house and it wasn’t even halfway dead. I was so excited I shared it with my custody lawyer secretary and she went and bought hers hours after I let her use mine.

  This is amazing. I ordered once after I read like, a thousand reviews and my sister raved about her CrossWave. I am in love with it. I have 3 kiddos (4 and under) and 3 dogs and it's now my daily vacuum. My floors stay so much cleaner and it's fast and easy. Cleaning out the tank is a little gross but that's because of the dog hair, the liquid is super easy to dump and rinse. The self cleaning feature of the brush roller makes me never want to use my traditional vacuum again. Sure, it's not as good as a traditional mop or hands and knees scrubbing, but if you're busy and on the fence, this is the ticket! I don't think it's worth it for carpet or rugs but we have a mix of tile, hardwood and linoleum and is perfect. 2000 Sq ft and I've never run out of battery

   Honestly worth the investment! I have 3 kids and one dog and our hardwoods get soo dirty so fast - and I hate sweeping/mopping! So this is a life saver!! I even use it on the tiles in our bathrooms and entryways! The only thing I wish was better is the ability to clean corners and close to walls or other tight spots. But for the big jobs it’s perfection and so easy to maneuver and clean! Definitely recommend

  This appliance has revolutionized my life. Before I hated mopping, but now I use this like a vacuum an it happens to also mop the floor at the same time.It’s not really meant for DEEP cleaning, but used regularly, there really isn’t a need to deep clean since the floors will be kept clean. Only issue is that it doesn’t clean all the way to the walls, so if there is a mess there, you will need to clean it up in another way. It does suck the dirt and dust away from the walls, though.

  I'm a skeptic.  Even after reading reviews, watching YouTube comparisons, etc. I have a hard time believing the hype.  With this vacuum floor cleaner, believe the hype.  I've had a Hoover.  A Bissel.  A FloorMate I've spent anywhere from $150 - $400 for a floor cleaner, nothing has worked as well as this Tineco.  No, it's not cheap.  Neither is the required cleaner.  But believe me when I say it is well worth the money.  It runs itself.  Yes, the clean and dirty water containers could be bigger.  But the beauty of this vacuum is how lightweight.  And part of that is the smaller tanks.  I'll take it.  It is helping me keep up with 3 dogs and 11-hour workdays.

  Just two people in my home, we don't wear shoes in the house, we don't mess much and I clean often even though there isn't much to clean and everything is always tidy. I thought my floors were clean... until I used this... ewwww! The water was so dark and nasty! I am shocked!! I typically use a swifter wet jet for ease and then a steamer for the deep clean. I had no idea the filth that lay on my hardwood! Ewwww! I am very stoked my sister told me about this machine. Now my mom plans to get one after I sent them pictures of the nastiness of the water. I am super particular with my cleaning or at least I thought I was. Seriously buy this... I have had it for a day but that 1st cleaning gets me to excited to clean the floors again today.

  This is a great little, convenient unit.  However, I don’t feel it’s worth the price I paid.  It’s great that it talks to me and tells me when the tanks are empty or full because I get distracted when I’m cleaning and don’t always notice it, but do I really need to track my “cleaning habits” on my iPhone?  The answer is no.  Another reason I wish I had bought “the other brand”, is that this gadget DOES NOT clean close to the walls.  It leaves about a 2” gap of uncleaned, unmopped space along all of the walls.  If you think this is going to take the place of your swiffer vac, or your regular mopping, deep cleaning chore, you’re wrong.  This is no “Rosie Robot”.  At best, it’s fantastic for spills and a light “swish” before company comes. Also, don’t be fooled by the “self cleaning” feature. It does a pretty good job of rinsing off the roller, but you still have to take all of the removable parts off and  rinse them.  Finally, do not expect this cleaner to just tuck away in a closet or corner. When it’s on the base/charger, it leans awkwardly forward and not snug against the wall. In the picture, the top of the handle is about 15 inches off my wall.

Not to mention when trying to work with their customer service, their customer service is in China and their warehouse is in some other location. They have no way to contact via phone their warehouse when I have tried desperately and waited over 40 days to try to get a replacement charging base. Calling and emailing them every single week for 40 days and all they can say is that they’re sorry. This unit does not work if it cannot be charged via battery charging unit making a $400 investmentCompletely worthless. All three charging units on all three mop vacuums have failed and two of those the actual unit it’s self failed. The worst company to do business with that I’ve ever in my life experienced and I’ve experienced some bad things.

Super easy to use, and I loved being able to vacuum and mop at the same time, especially with 5 dogs in the house.  However, my machine stopped working in less than 2 months.

  The only issue is that the battery does not last long enough to mop my whole house.  However, it does an amazing job.  I have 2100 square feet to mop.  If you have a smaller home that should not be an issue.  To me it is worth it regardless of the battery time issue.  I just put it back on the charger and do other chores around the house, then finish mopping when the battery is recharged.  I know the floor is clean because i tested it.  I take a wet paper towel and try to get any dirt left by the mop and literally nothing is on the paper towel.  I would recommend this product to everyone who has laminate or wood floors.  It is worth every penny.UPDATE:  I used it for three months.  It just one day stopped working.  I get it, these things happen.  I called because it is under warranty.  Its been a month and I feel like I am getting the run around.  At first they said they will send me a new base because they thought maybe this was the problem.  The base never showed up.  I called and they said they were going to send me a whole new unit.  The unit still has not shown up.  Its unfortunate that the customer service is not what it should be.

  So used to vacuuming before mopping! This is the greatest idea someone ever had. Works very well and was worth the purchase price for its self cleaning abilities alone. Ease of use and connection is another major plus. The only downside so far is that it doesn’t quite get into the corners and edges of the floor near the wall. But for a quick daily cleanup it has been a dream!

  It’s good for regular cleaning and spill cleanup. For dried old dirty spots, you may still need to clean separately by hand. One annoying issue I have with it is the air coming out of the tiny holes of the roller cover will blow pet hair away while cleaning.

  I've been using a Shark steam mop for about 5 years, and it stopped hearing up so I needed to replace it. Having something to avoid scrubbing my floors is crucial to daily life because I have a back problem, and I have 2 years old twins. Our floors get very dirty very fast with our kids, and because my husband is deployed right now, I can't spend a ton of time cleaning the floor every day.Pros:1. You can choose the temperature of the water via your faucet... so it does not heat up the water, and that should make it safe to use on pretty much all flooring types.2. It does not use a lot of water, and so the floors dry very quickly.3. It only cleans the floor with clean water, unlike a standard mop. You can seriously feel the difference on the floors.4. It is relatively quiet, similar to a standard vacuum.5. The self cleaning function is really amazing, and the parts that do need to be washed are simple and quick to clean.Cons:1. If you don't pay attention to the lower compartment (dirty water), and it gets too full the dirty water will leak out.2. The battery is not replaceable, but it hasn't died on me while cleaning.3. It is motorized... and I'm not sure this is actually a con, but it will get away from you if you aren't holding it firmly.4. It doesn't get edges or corners.Overall, this has been a lifesaver for me, and I am completely satisfied with the purchase.

   I have a teenager, a toddler and 2 dogs so there’s always food and dirt from the dogs on the floor. This cleans better than the normal vacuum and good old mop. When I pass the regular mop it doesn’t leave a white streak like it does in the pic because you are cleaning with dirty water. The Tineco has a clean and dirty tank so it never cleans with the same water. I am amazed at how well this works and it saves time BUT now with the cons…… it’s a little annoying to have to clean the dirty water tank after each use so I can’t just clean up a little mess and leave the tineco with the dirty water. Also, the water tank is very small so I had to refill it 3x to clean my kitchen and along with refilling the tank, that comes with having to dispense the dirty water tank too. Cleans so well that I decided to keep it and deal with the tanks. If you have a small apartment this shouldn’t be a big deal.

  I have two toddlers and a non shedding dog. I use this only once a week but spot sweep and hand clean big spills in between. I'd say my floors see a lot of messes but are pretty clean and should be an easy job for this appliance. I still find myself running it on Max every time I use it because even with relatively clean floors I just don't feel like it does a great job on the regular setting. We have quite a bit of laminate wood flooring and I also need to change the tanks quite often and recharge two to three times to get all my floors. Obviously that's in part because of running the appliance on Max but I have to do what I have to do for it to be effective. On that max setting I would definitely say that it leaves my floors as clean as a sweep and manual mop. Even with the added hassle of charging and tank changing it is a lot less work overall. Sometimes I just don't have the time to recharge so I end up doing some of my floors the old fashioned way. I feel like this is an amazing idea that still needs some improvement. I'm happy that I purchased it but look forward to possibly a better model in the future

  I've had this for about a year and I use it every couple of weeks to clean hardwood floors and tiled areas. I have to say, it does an excellent job. My expectation on this unit is that it will last a couple of years and will cost about $20 per month over that period, so I cam particularly concerned with longevity. Having said that, I don't see any particular need to worry.For me, it replaces the god awful job of mopping with a microfiber mop and then drying afterwards. That involves an incredible amount of leg work, hand wringing, and time, as well as back breaking trips to replace and mix soap and hot water.This incredible item does a better job than I could in all but the tightest of corners. It cleans incredibly well and then sucks up that dirty water, hair and bits.  Cleanup is a little involved, but definitely a better overall process than mopping and a better job. The only thing you need besides this is a ""cleaning sock"" on your foot for those tough stuck on stains like wax or chocolate.  A cleaning sock is just a pair of socks that you throw in the laundry afterwards.Anyway, one tank of water is enough to clean about 800 sqft of hardwood floor (about a single story with bathrooms. After that, you need to empty the dirty water and refill the clean water. The only other thing I do is vacuum weekly.Overall its a tremendous piece of technology. A real time and effort saver. Thanks Tineco.

   Update May 2021 : I’m knocking it down 2 stars because this thing hardly works anymore. I always clean it out and run a cleaning cycle between each use, and I never overfill water or let water sit on the pieces so I don’t know why I have so many issues. It’s constantly going through phases where it will let me run it for a few seconds then shuts off. It also alternates flashing some of the lights when unnecessary (which also leads to it not letting me run it). When it does work, it hardly cleans the floors. I have wood floors, no hard grooves, and my floors do not get as clean as they used to. When it does work for me, I only get use out of it for small messes a whole bucket and mop would be a waste to get out for. Bummer. Tempted to try the newest version but these things aren’t cheap..First off, this thing is awesome if you hate cleaning. Personally, I find sweeping and mopping the old fashioned way daunting. This cuts cleaning time in HALF. If not more. My whole main level is hard wood. The only issue I have is battery life. 20ish minutes of clean time, 4 hours of charging. Not ideal for someone with as much floor as I have. However, if I deep clean more often, this will be PERFECT for daily maintenance!  Seriously, battery life is the ONLY negative I have to say. Self cleaning is amazing! Easy to empty the dirty reservoir and easy to refill! Love that it’s cordless and that it shows battery life. Another huge plus, is that it lets you know when it needs to be emptied/filled/self cleaned! One of the best investments I have EVER made in my 11 years of adulthood!

   This review is for the S3. I purchased myself on prime day after seeing the multiple reviews on Tiktok with people using it to clean up crazy items. I figured since I'm not typically throwing raw eggs on the ground this vacuum would be able to handle the little flyaway dust that accumulates on a daily basis due to my 4 pets.Take a look at the photos. This thing doesn't pick up diddly squat (the photos are 5 passes over the same spot), it leaves streaks, water spots, and the self cleaning cycle is infuriating. I'd rather lug around my corded vacuum and mop the old way.

  Loved it at first, but it’s been about 10 months of owning it and using it almost daily - sometimes even more than 2 times in a day. All of a sudden it leaks like crazy and leaves puddles EVERYWHERE. I have called customer service 3 times now and they keep saying they will email me within 24 hours and we can discuss the next steps to “fix” my issue. I send a full paragraph explaining the problem and a video showing what’s wrong and ALL the information they asked for. First email response from them is an apology and maybe these trouble shooting steps will fix it (seriuously? Did you not take the time to hear what my issue was and that I already ran the troubleshooting and not even look at the video showing what the issue was?). Okay fine, I call again and tell them that I already ran troubleshooting and that the machine is obviously broken and I would like it fixed. They respond with okay we will send a label to return it and we can fix it - I’m thing okay perfect finally making some progress, but I waited a full 24 hours for that email with the label and to no surprise I get nothing. I call again where I get the same work around and same responses please wait for our email and we will get back to you as soon as possible. This is infuriating at this point. It should not take 3+ days to help a customer especially when the machine falls within the warranty period. Worst customer service I’ve dealt with to date.Tineco is a nightmare to work with and I want a full refund seeing as I will need to replace my once loved machine. But Tineco has totally lost my business. 2 year warranty is a complete lie. If you want your money going towards something that’ll last then get another machine.

    Makes cleaning so much easier!
  
","









  
  
    
  This vacuum/mop makes cleaning sooo much easier. It does a really good job at cleaning up dirt and pet hair. I would however would like to see a bigger tank for the solution and waste. I have to add more solution and waste about 3-4 times when cleaning the entire house. My house isn’t that big so it does get kind of annoying to have to stop to add more solution and empty the tank. I would recommend adding more solution/emptying the tank at the same time, otherwise you will have to keep stopping since the solution doesn’t always run out at the same time that the tank fills up (vise versa). It also doesn’t do well around the edges/corners. You can make it go all the way to the wall but it won’t clean the last inch so you can still see the dirt on there.

  I used my Tineco for nine months and LOVED it! It was such a breeze to use and really got my floors clean. I was meticulous about cleaning it after every use; it stayed like new. Now it randomly stopped working, for no reason I can see. I have tried contacting the company for assistance with ABSOLUTELY ZERO response. I have called the helpline, left voicemail messages, sent emails, and submitted to their ""live chat"". Each platform says someone will ""get back to me soon""... it's been a few days, I have not been contacted, no one will respond to any more inquiries, and now I'm stuck with a useless machine that doesn't work for longer than four seconds. Absolute waste of money.

Very easy to set up out of box,  I have just used it once, but it was very easy. I always thought my floors were clean, but after I used this, the floor had a different type of clean feeling, walking on them, they just felt so clean. I LOVE that the charging station is built in. I also love how they sent another roller and filter to switch out once I am cleaning the other. I have 3 kids, 4, 2, 1 and a dog- having this is a life saver!

  This product cleans really well. The reason why I bought it was because of the self cleaning feature but its not 100% self cleaning. After each use you have to clean the collection tank, filter, and the brush. If you dont clean the brush after each use and let it dry out completely, it will smell like wet rag. Using a standard mop and bucket can be argued to have a easier cleaning process.

  Great for quick clean ups and sanitizing the floor for our LO who is crawling. Gets rid of all the muddy paw prints from pets and even sucks up her shed hair. The water tanks are small so there’s need for frequent refills BUT it’s simple and quick to do so I don’t mind. Sweeping or swifering prior to using the mop enhances its effectiveness but is not necessary for me personally. I definitely recommend this product, especially if you have pets or kids.

    Very pleased with this cleaner

  I only have tile floors in my house, so I'm always looking for the easiest way to clean them. I've have had a couple other hard floor cleaners in the past that I'd only bring out to do a deep clean on my floors. That other cleaners wer heavy, loud, hard to maneuver, and then hard to maintain (I could never get it clean). When I first received the Tineco, I was concerned that it wouldn't give me that deep clean I desired. I have come to believe this is a much better machine. It is so light-weight, so easy to maneuver and OMG so easy to maintain. In fact, it's so easy to use, now my floors are cleaner than they have ever been. All because it I use it much more often. I've only had it a couple of weeks, so I can't say how well it will last, but they machine seems well built enough that I don't think that will be a concern. Very happy with this purchase!

   I found it difficult to believe that a vacuum can clean up hair and dirt and mop at the same time.  Boy I was wrong.  I absolutely LOVE this hard floor vacuum.  It’s simple to use daily and so incredibly quiet.Sorry about the shoe at the end of the video....but hey, you can see the suction.  Lol.

    Cleans itself more than it cleans the floors
  
","









  
  
    
  It works great for touch ups, but I wanted something to deep clean. I have a nine month old grandbaby who is crawling and wanted the floors to be as clean as possible.  This little guy is very light duty, in my opinion.  The clean water tank and dirty water tank are tiny. I have to empty and refill just doing my kitchen and living room area (not a very big area at all). That's fine, I can deal with that. But I always sweep very well before I use this wet/dry vac and I still have to disassemble, rinse all the parts (spinning brush, brush cover, and dirty water tank) before I get through one cycle of my two main living areas. The self cleaning alert still pops on. I place it on the base and set it to self clean twice for every time I use it.  We have named it the pet cat because it just wants to clean itself all the time.

  The product works great until it doesn’t. We’ve had our Tineco for less than 6 months, and we’ve already had to send it back to get it repaired because of some motor issue. That’s really disappointing considering how much we paid for this device. Customer service was good in helping us to send it in to get fixed, but who knows how long it’ll take until it’s returned to us. We have two toddlers and a dog and need a reliable product. Unfortunately, this Tineco isn’t one.

  This Tineco Floor One S3 is amazing. I read over 50 reviews and watched consumer videos and then I saw a picture of a lady hugging the box it came in.  Ok, nobody hugs a product box unless they love it!I have had every floor cleaner there is.  None of them work as good as this one.  My home is about a  2,300 sq ft  and I can go through my whole house on a full battery charge. You can actually see the vacuum pulling the dirt towards itself.  It’s super easy to fill and empty the tanks and change the mop head.  I  recommended it to everyone I know with hard surface floors.  I also purchased one for our business office and one for a gift.Yes, that’s 3 of them!!!!

  I purchased this item with the warranty and unfortunately, it did not make it a year. Not knowing how to start the warranty process. I contacted Amazon directly. Well, that didn't help because she only gave me a refund and not even for the full amount. The warranty won't cover a replacement because there is a a manufacturer warranty on it. So I called Tineco to get this working as I can't buy a new cleaner if I don't even have the full amount to replace it. That is the reason I bought the warranty! Tineco refused to help since I was given a refund and Amazon took the refund back because I'm not sending the product back without a full refund. A manager from Tineco was supposed to call back months ago and there have been crickets. I will update this review once Tineco makes this right.

  I have family members who offer to assist with the floor cleaning but refuse to vacuum prior to mopping which does nothing but slosh dirty water all over my floors.  This product has been just the solution to save both my sanity and marriage :)  It is easy to maneuver even for someone who is older without much strength, and with the low profile, it can get under table and chairs with ease.  The suction power is perfect for hardwood floors, and tile.  The automated voice that provides instruction for actions to be taken (self cleaning, changing water tanks, etc.) is loud and clear. Within the box the company provides an extra brush and filter which makes it convenient to swap out when the prior needs to dry after cleaning.  After 6 months of using this tool within our main home, I bought another for our vacation rental. Would highly recommend.

  This little machine is the perfect mop and vacuum in one. Very easy to use and cleanup afterwards. I have 2 very large dogs who have unlimited access to the house though a doggie door. This machine not only pick up the debris they bring in but also their hair.  Everything comes apart for quick cleaning and has its own tray for drying. The battery lasts for about 30 minutes and that gives me enough time to do the whole downstairs. Yes it's a little pricey but well worth it, the time it saves me and I can walk barefoot in the house again.

  Waited for months to see this in stock and bought it. It’s absolutely worth it! I love not needing to sweep before mopping! I just pick up larger trash and leave crumbs and dog hair for the Tineco. This is amazing to clean up after toddlers. The only downside I see is it’s not great for larger homes. I usually have to refill at least once or twice. And I don’t like how it won’t get sticky spots up. It’s perfect for daily cleaning. I have to spot clean sticky areas because the Tineco can’t do it. I also love how dry it leaves the floor. It doesn’t leave much water behind. Worth the cost.

    Cuts vacuum and mop time in half
  
","









  
  
    
  This has literally cut my floor cleaning time in half! I normally vacuum then I steam mop, and this has made it easy to do both at once. Its not great for corners and small spaces like on either side of the toilet or something because it doesn't fit, but for large spaces, it's great. The kitchen has never been easier to clean. Note that in order for things not to smell, you need to clean out the dirty water tank every time and take out the brush to dry or else over time it will start to smell and therefore smells up your floors when you clean, which defeats the point of the whole cleaning thing. If the dirty water tank does get smelly, a drop of soap or some sort of cleaning solution and scrub it a little and it'll be good. Bonus points that it's cordless.The last point is that while this is great for quick spills, if something dries on the floor, it will not get cleaned right away. You'll have to bend down and scrape a little with something rough or your finger or something then go over it with the vacmop. Overall, I'm very pleased with this and works great for my first floor since it's almost all hardwood. The solution smells nice and isn't too overpowering, which is great. I don't like super strong smells.

  This machine is incredible! I’ve tried everything in the past to get my floors clean with two toddlers. Regular mop, spin mop, steam mop, a bissel carpet cleaner machine.... EVERYTHING. This is the first thing that has made me feel like the dirt isn’t just getting pushed around the floor. I wiped the floor with a white paper towel after using the iFloor to see if any dirt got left behind and it was completely clean. Favorite cleaning tool purchase ever - even better than my Dyson vacuum!

  I think I got this product with too high expectations. It does a decent job vacuuming and mopping, just don't expect it to completely replace your vacuum and mop. It struggles with larger pieces and it really only cleans easy to get spots. I still have to get out my steam mop if I want the floor to be completely clean. Cleaning it up afterwards is also pain since you have to disassemble it to rinse every piece off (and, unsurprisingly, it gets nasty very quickly, so clean it up right away afterward. Learn from my mistake. Don't just go to bed and say you'll get it on the morning.) I also wish it had the option of a more natural cleaning solution.To sum it up, it's good for weekly maintenance, but you'll still want to bring out the tried and true tools every once in a while. I'm not certain if I would buy again.

  Just buy it. If you’re on the fence about which combination vacuum/mop to buy, this is the correct one.I had a Crosswave Premier before this and was rather dissatisfied with its cleaning performance. Most other people seemed to love it, so I thought maybe I was doing something incorrectly. It left my floors streaky, unevenly clean, and the suction left a lot to be desired (both for vacuuming and for water pickup).I returned that product and got this one for around the same price. The difference is night and day. I had last cleaned my floors with the Crosswave two weeks ago; after using this product once, the dirty water tank frankly looked embarrassing.It cleans evenly, extracts enough water that my floors are dry in minutes, actually has enough power to scrub significant messes, and it does all this while being cordless and having decent battery life. Note that I do have LiDAR-equipped robot vacuums (the Roborock S6) that dutifully keep most dust/dirt under control, but every couple of weeks I go over them with this product for a deep clean.I genuinely don’t mind cleaning my floors now, which is something I never thought I’d say.

  My house is approximately 2000 square feet with wood floor and tile in the bathrooms and laundry room. I like to mop twice a month but this is great for inbetween deep cleanings. I use this mainly on the tile floors to really ensure it’s clean in places where we’re barefoot or get dirty such as the laundry room where the dogs stay. Battery life is decent. It is particularly needy with having to empty the dirty water bin but could be because of the dog hair.

  Love this item! I purchased it on Prime day and wanted to give it enough time to try it out before reviewing. This product is by far better than any floor product I have used. If you have a pet you 1000% need this product. This product is perfect for those that need a vacuum/mop but aren’t able to use a steam mop because of floor texture (vinyl). This mop gets the floors as wet as a mop and dries quickly. There is no steam feature for this products. The only down side I have found for this product is you are suppose to purchase their brand cleaner and it has been sold out for months due to this product blowing up on tik tok. Their warranty does not cover using alternative products. Also if you do not clean out the dirty water tank and dry out each piece after use it will mold.

  I have almost all hardwood or tile floors. I have spent an inordinate amount of time mopping and sweeping. Then my daughter told me to get one of these and my life changed. It takes almost no time to clean all my floors. I have been a bit appalled at the color of the water in the dirty tank but it's getting less disgusting the more I clean.  Having 2 dogs and 2 cats makes for some grubby and hairy floors. Not anymore! It doesn't do carpets well so I don't use it for the one room that has that. But I LOVE THIS THING!!!

  Not what I expected!! I have ceramic tile, and young kids, who ya know, make sticky messes. I am sure if you caught the sticky mess right away this would be great, but I work full-time away from my home. By the time we get around to running it, the wet mop part is rendered almost useless. So definitely don’t expect it to perform miracles on your floors... you’ll still have to sweep or run a dry vac for most of your floors, use another mop for a deeper clean, then use this. We run a robot vac throughout the week, then this on the weekend or as needed.Another pet peeve is how crazy fast the dirty water tank fills up before you have to empty it out and clean it out too.Last pet peeve, the battery run time. The battery on eco mode (a harder scrubbing action) last like 15 minutes of run time.The one big thing I do love is the suction power for the liquids. The floor dries incredibly fast! Follow this by the self cleaning feature.These gadgets are promising, but haven’t quite reached where it’s supposed to just yet. This is a great quick floor mop to maintain everyday, but don’t expect this to be some heavy duty machine that takes all the burden of vacuuming and mopping in one go!

  We been using this for a month or so now and we are very impressed with it so far no leaks no streaks or anything picks up hair (human, dog, and cat) without any problems it's easy to clean and easy to use and the self cleaning process is so so good for the roller but that's it still a lot of manual cleaning after the self cleaning and it sucks that it doesn't get all the way to the wall leaves a 1/2 in gap that has to be cleaned around the walls but other than that it great.

  Had a little trouble getting the water to come out the first time I used it. I'm not even sure how I fixed it, I just messed with it a bit and now it works great. My floors were so gross. A warning for those with pets though, I probably should have run a broom over the floor to get most of the hair up first, it gets caught and fills up the dirty tank very quickly.

    UPDATE TO MY REVIEW - Don't waste your time.
  
","









  
  
    
  This is an update - I have had this item for less than a year and it broke in the beginning of November. The motor quit functioning properly. I contacted customer service and was told I needed to send the item back and as soon as they received the vacuum they would send me a new one. It has been over a month of excuses and I currently have no replacement or any resolution in site. Don't waste your money or time!I have 3 dogs, 3 kids and lots of hardwood floors.  I can't get over how well the TINECO cleans the floors & vacuums all the dog hair up.  It does not leave my walnut floors overly wet and it really sucks up the dirt (see my picture).  It is super easy to clean and a full charge will cover all my hard surface areas.  I am so happy I spent the money on this.  It has made mopping / vacuuming so much easier and less time consuming.

  Y'all ready for a 5 start review?  I just used my Tineco Floor 1 cordless for the first time.  I hadn't moped since after Christmas and hadn't vacuumed since yesterday.  I am SO excited!  I'm a sucker for convenience saving cleaning devices and technology.  You name it and when I could afford it within reason, I get it.  I have an old Eufy vacuum, named Rosy, a Shark vacuum with the 30 day reservoir - Jaws, a battery operated scrub brush.  I've an old Floor Mate, 2 regular size carpet cleaners - different brands in my hall closet.  Plus a Dyson stick cordless - Suckered.  I had been seeing a competitor's version on TV and was really interested in it.  Did my research and decided on ""Tina"" instead.  I took her out of the box just over an hour ago.  Simple to put together.  Did I mention I don't read instructions?  Put her on her charger but couldn't wait for a full charge.  Mopped my kitchen - waterproof Pergo- and the living room, 2 small halls with adjoining small bathrooms - tile - on less than a 75% charge.  Maneuvers like a dream.  A little difficult going around the toilets, not hey.  Cleaned very well, even cleaned up washable creation and pencil marks from grand children and spill splashes from Christmas that got missed.  The auction was great, even got a small bug (don't judge, the doors were opened a lot).  I was amazed at how dirty the reservoir water was.  Tina let me know when to empty and when to refill.  She warned me when the battery was starting to get to low and took me through the steps for the self cleaning.  The hardest part I have is replacing the clean water reservoir.  Again I don't read instructions.  Sorry this review is so long but at the moment, I'm in love.  If anything changes, I'll update my review.

    Gotta give you the dirt on this vacuum!

  I was super excited to get this on sale during Prime days.  I have had many months to use it and therefore have experienced it enough to give my honest review of it.  I purchased this because we own a german shepherd and anyone who has a dog that sheds as much will understand why I wanted this all-in-one vacuum and mop wonder.  I follow all directions and use only the cleanser that was included with the product fyi. Even though we groom our dog and I do my floors every single day, this still would clog so quickly.  Everything from the dirty collection cup down to where the roller brush is.  After using it only 5 minutes it would want to ""self-clean"".  Which means it would have to be put on the charger again, and then I'd have to constantly empty and fill the dirty and clean cups.  To the point to where I ended up buying another vacuum (Shark brand) just to vacuum the hair before I even used the Tineco.  Which kind of defeats the purpose of having it.  Now, if it actually mopped well enough I would overlook this and happily keep using it.  However, the gaps it leaves along the sides and in the front against a wall, etc. knocks out the fully clean floors look for me.  We mostly have hard wood floors and you can see any amount of dust or hair left. So needless to say, I am not happy with this purchase nor would I recommend it.  Not even to houses without pets on account of the amount that's left around all edges.

    KILLS THE CROSSWAVE
  
","









  
  
    
  I purchased the Tineco S3 at the same time as a Bissell Crosswave Pro so that I would not ever wonder if I purchased the wrong one.  The bissell was sent back pretty immediately.  This is for hard flooring only and the crosswave is supposed to be able to switch back and forth between hard flooring and carpet.The dirt left behind with the crosswave called it for me.  I don't care if it can do a ""decent job"" on two types of flooring.  I would rather own two units that do an immaculate job on their specified flooring.  I like my  house clean!!! not semi clean!The suction on this with it being cordless is absolutely impressive.  The roller is so compact it is perfect for hard flooring.My only complaints are - battery life.  But its a fair trade for it being cordless!  Second complaint is the smaller water tank,  BUT! again it alerts you to clean it out so that it can continue to clean with full power/suction.  It really is an all around well thought out product.The cherry on top is the Tineco is aesthetically pleasing.  So if you do not have somewhere to store it and it has to be left out in the open it's not a giant purple or green eye sore.

  I've used this vacuum cleaner for over 2 weeks. The suction power is strong enough to clean the small pieces on the floor. The floor is a little bit damp after using the cleaner but it will dry in 1 to 2 minutes. It doesn't leave streaks and also removes the stains on the floor pretty easy. The vacuum cleaner is light weight and one good thing is that it moves forward so it will save you some energy. The battery can last about 30 minutes and you might need to empty the dirty water tank once in the middle. It will also remind you to run the self cleaning function after each use to keep it clean. Very easy to install and remove the water tanks and the roller. It's smaller than what I thought so it doesn't take a lot of space. Overall I'm satisfied with my purchase and it saves a lot of work on cleaning the hard floor.

  You know you're an adult when you get excited about getting a vacuum in the mail! I spent weeks online trying to find one that would be perfect for my floors. I live in a house built in the 1940's and the hardwood is the original flooring without any sealant on it. So, I was hesitant about buying a wet/dry vacuum for this reason. I took the plunge and bought this one and I am so glad I did! To test it I only did a small patch on my floor. Oh my gosh!!!! I don't think those floors have ever been clean before I moved in! I had a Swif**r but I didn't feel it was actually cleaning. Now I know it wasn't because that small patch I went over looks like a different floor!! I am waiting until those little parasites that live with me go away for the summer. Then, it is just me and my vacuum making the living room a better place. A little music and some wine...then hello clean floors! Well worth the price!

    If you have wood floors, this is a MUST
  
","









  
  
    
  No matter how well I would dust/vacuum our wooden floors there was always that line of debris when mopping/swiffering etc afterwards. This has easily cut the cleaning of our floors in half, more like 70% honestly. It practically moves itself with just a little push. Always using clean water so you're not using the dirty water to clean your floors. It's not the best at getting close to the floorboards or corners of the room but the little extra time I take to clean those manually is nothing compared to the overall saving of time. The self-cleaning mode is also incredible. Run, do not walk to purchase this product. Especially if you have wood flooring.

  Great great mop cleaner. It’s very easy to use. Light weight and very easy to clean with. Best part is how everything comes apart to clean it thoroughly and everything goes back in right places without any problems. The only things I’d say i don’t like about it, even thou i love it overall, is that i have to fill water and clean dirty water three times to mop my whole floor. However i don’t often mop the entire floor in one setting, so it not a deal breaker to me. I’d prefer smaller mop anyway and fill it more times then not having space for giant one.Also i love that when it’s charged it’ll stop charging even if it’s still plugged in. I was concerned about that when it says it takes 6-8 hours to charge. That I’d leave it on charge to long. But it stops charging.

It was definitely a good buy. 👍It vacuums and mom's at the same time.The only down side is when it's time to dump the water 💧 it's so gross but it's better than having it on your floors. Now they need to invent one to clean walls and ceiling fan blades. Does get to corners or edges but good for everyday messes.Overall I give it a 9.1

    Died after first charge
  
","









  
  
    
  It cleans great, it charged up the first time just fine. I used it for about almost an hour until the battery died using the max cleaning (I like my house to be clean thank you very much), and it did great on the cleaning. Once the battery gets down to 20% however, it does this annoying countdown, and freezes at 1% until the battery dies like 10-15 minutes later.After that however, my Tineco Floor One S3 adamantly refuses to charge (basically, it charged once and hasn't since then), and I've spent days going around and around with Tineco support. They keep telling me to check the same things over and over again like that's magically going to change since the last time they asked. They're completely unconcerned about fixing a faulty product.Update: It appears if you attempt to call them, you just get a recording saying they cannot accept your call, and to use live chat (which doesn't really exist) or submit an email ticket, which is what gets you in an endless loop of ""check the pins, check that it's plugged in, etc."" and then they wait 24 hours+ to actually respond again after you reply.

  The overall product is good but not great, I’ve been using it for my hard wood floors and I noticed that the roll leaves more water behind leaving marks and even the floor wet, which at the beginning it would dry completely. Also, the brush roll gets a humid smell even if washed and left to dry completely and using the original cleaning liquid. So, when I use it I detect that smell around my house. Needs really good cleaning every time it’s used because even if you use the self cleaning button it keeps hairs and dirt everywhere. Note** I don’t own any pets or have babies at home so my floors are not too dirty just daily use.

  I was soooo excited to get this. I have seen it on tik tok and the reviews and videos were great.  I waited 4 months going back and forth since it was a big purchase and I broke down and got it.  I have 4 dogs in my house and 3 kids so my floors get muddy and dirty.  I vacuum first to keep most of the hair out of it and use it mostly for a mop.  I hate that I get only halfway done with one room and I have to stop for the self cleaning then have to empty and refill before finishing and the same for the next room and then by that time the battery is dead.  I also was hoping it would be able to get tar off but it doesn't.  I do feel like my floors get clean and like it better than a mop but it's time consuming after emptying and filling and waiting for the battery to charge.

  Best wet vac I've owned so far, I've also owned a Bissel Wave and a Hoover Floormate. The Wave didn't clean very well and lasted just over a year while the Floormate cleaned fairly well, had good suction, but dumped a lot of water on the foor, was extremely loud and lasted less than 6 months before the motor rusted out. I've had the Tineco a few months now and it is by far the best. It is comparatively quiet, cleans very well and leaves little water behind. It is light and sleek. I wish the fresh and dirty water tanks were larger and would prefer it to be corded so I don't have to worry about battery life; however, you can get through at least 2 fresh tanks on the max mode with the battery and you can cover a lot of ground in that time. The self clean feature is awesome and I usually run 2 cycles so the water is nearly clear. Easy to disassemble for more thorough cleaning. Tineco, please sell a disinfectant cleaner!

  So I’ve had this for over a month not and wanted to wait until I used it a bit before making a review. I absolutely LOVE it! It’s so easy, gets the floors SO clean! I have 4 toddlers and they’re SO messy at the table and get their food everywhere on the floor. I quickly use this after each meal around the table and in the kitchen after cleaning the kitchen every time and it’s been amazing! It makes cleaning/keeping hardwood floors clean way easier! The only annoying thing is how fast it gets full.

  We have a German Shepard, we will sweep most of the hair up first to avoid clogging. Once we get to the tineco, it cleans our wood floors like you wouldn’t believe. I wouldn’t call it a wet mop, it surpasses any mop I’ve used. Would buy again for sure

  I absolutely LOVE my Tineco iFLOOR3! It does the job and then some! The cleaning solution smells lovely. My only complaint is that when I rage clean I occasionally bump into things harder than I should and the dirty water has a tendency to spill somehow 😆 but that’s my fault! Cuts the cleaning time in less than half for me and I am definitely happy I bought it! As long as the cleaning solution being out of stock won’t be a regular problem then I will remain a customer!

  Great machine.- not a five star because it definitely needs LED lighting.- easy to clean.- not very loud. We clean after our kids are in bed without a worry.- great battery life. I would say we clean about 800sqt ft on one charge. Kitchen, dining, living room, & hall.- easy to refill which we have to do once when cleaning everything. But machine feels light weight so wouldn’t want a bigger tank.

  Gets up all the tiny little bits on the floor and helps a lot with the dog hair on the hardwood floors...not so much in carpet.

Unfortunately, the past few times I’ve used it, the battery drains extremely quick. It charges to 100%, and by the time I’m done using it in my small kitchen, it drops to 60%. Usually I could get my whole house done and still have 40% left.

  I was a little disappointed with my purchase. The expectations were set high with all the hype. The reality of it is, I have a long haired German Shepherd and matte LVP floors that show everything. It would leave streaks, didn’t do the best at cleaning up dried dog prints, only allowed me to get an inch away from baseboards, wasn’t great at getting under certain furniture pieces, and the “self clean” is a multi step, hands on process. While it feels like it saved me time during the actual cleaning due to not having to vacuum as much before, it didn’t save me time on the back end and didn’t have the best quality of clean in my opinion. I returned it as I feel the quality didn’t match the price. As sad as I am to say, turns out I like the results of my Dyson, robo vac, and my steam mop more than the Tineco.

  I’ve had this machine about 2 weeks now. A friend recommended it to me and it finally went on sale. I am so glad I bought it! I have 2 dogs and a main coon cat. The hair is unreal!! I let my Roomba run daily but it barely touched the hair from those 3.  The Tineco gets every bit of it up and cleans the floors perfectly in one pass. I can clean 1300 square feet of LVP floors thoroughly with less than a full tank. Then, I just place it on the charging station, run it through a cleaning cycle and empty the dirty water tank. Easy enough. I’m not sure why some of the other reviewers are having to change the water so often. It’s really a very simple process and worth the price!

  I've recently moved into a new place with all tile/hardwood flooring downstairs and one room upstairs.  I hate cleaning and really can't stand mopping or sweeping.  So I was looking for a good solution that would be easy to keep the floors clean and looking nice.  Boy am I happy I got this device.  It does the job very well.  I leave it on the charging base with a cleaning tank full and pull it out anytime I need to clean up.  Anything from crumbs after dinner or snack time, to cleaning up potty messes by the new puppy.  This thing makes quick clean work of it all.  Best of all it is very very easy to clean.  My mom and friend have the Spinwave and it is a nightmare to keep clean and in working order.

  This is an easy way to kill two birds in one stone. It’s quick for clean up mess and easy to put away. I used it daily since I have kids and they are a mess. I wouldn’t said it’s a deep cleaning because if you have sticky food or debris on the floor it wouldn’t pick it up. Which I’m fine with it since Its not a big spot and I would just use a wet towel to wipe it off. The only thing I would complain about it that the cleaning water and dirty water tank is small. So if your house is big then you’ll have to dump and refills a couple of times to clean the whole house.

  Love the fact that this vacuums and washes at the same time. Saves time and effort!Given the choice again, I would have elected for the newer (higher priced) machine with the talking alarms. I find the lighted indicators are difficult to see with my ""older"" eyes.Our tile floors are definitely beautifully clean after using the ifloor3. Self clean is a great feature.Suggest you purchase an extra roller - permits wet one to dry while spare is installed.UpdateMuch as how convenient it is to vacuum and wash, I find it easier to use my vacuum before washing with Tineco.Reason ... cleaning the machine, rollers, channel, & tank, of hair and debris takes much less time and effort.

We mop the tile and hardwood weekly and the amount of dirt this picked up on what I thought were fairly clean floors is amazing (and a little disgusting and embarrassing 😳) the only negatives I notice so far is it doesn't get all the way up to the wall and if your grout lines are a little deeper it doesn't seem to get all the way down but there may be a deeper clean selection I haven't discovered yet. The battery life isn't long but it's Cordless so not sure how much you could expect from a portable Cordless device. Very impressed so far....likely never need a mop again!

  Amazing!!! I love mine. I have a handful of dogs so the hair in my house is CRAZY! I was a little worried the hair wouldn’t get pick up and it would leave one big wet hair ball on my floor. Boy was I wrong!!! It sucks the hair up like a champ. There are a couple times don’t get me wrong that if there is a lot of hair together I have to go over the area twice, but the second time it gets picked up. I can do my entire house before it tells me to self clean or to refill the water tank. I do have to empty the dirty tank at least once before I finish but that just proves it is picking up the hair, dirt, mud, slobber, food correctly. Highly recommend this to anyone!!

  Mom of three kids. Great for quick cleans. Definitely doesn’t not scrub your floor. Here’s the not so great:**Not quick to cleanup after using it-  I like to drain all water from clean tank each time, I use most of it anyways. I want it to dry out each time so it doesn’t get gross in any way. But the real ick is when you pull the dirty tank off, all the longer hair (from the girls) and other debris needs to be pulled out from the roller thats coming up into the tank. I also have to pull the hair out from inside the dirty tank bc it gets twisted around. Not my favorite part. After draining and slightly washing out the dirty tank, it takes up a lot of time.

  Purchased this vacuum for our hard wood floors.  Previously we would vacuum, then ""swiffer"".  The Tineco does both at the same time.  Very easy to assemble and the instructions are written very well.

  Very happy! It does such a great job, and quickly. Love that it’s cordless. Using the solution or not, it still works great. I have a black lab that sheds a lot and it will pick up most of the hair. If it’s a lot I might have to manually clean the machine little more, but it does a great job on the floor. Very happy with this machine!

    Reservoirs too small

  Only thing I could say negative about my Tineco iFloor3 is the reservoirs are too small. Maybe because I have a small dog in the house. I’m continuously emptying  the dirty water reservoir and filling the cleaning solution reservoir and that’s for one room. But other then that 1 minor issue I love it!!!!!!

  This is the best thing I ever owned. I never right a review but if I could I would give 10 stars. I have 3 kids ages from 7 to 2 years old and a dog. My floors were never ever clean. Always had spills of drinks milk and ice cream and dog makes a big mess also.I used mops and a steam mop still my floors were dirty. First time when I used Tineco omg I could not believe how dirty my floors were the dirty water was disgusting. I’m in love with this I use it all the time now my cleaning got easier and I actually enjoy cleaning and seeing the Squeaky clean floors. I am amazed and would recommend everyone that has kids to get this.

  I have used several electric or cordless floor cleaners and by far this one is the best.  Right out of the box you can tell what great quality it is.  The engineering for picking up dog hair and trapping it for easy removal is terrific.  It beats the Bissel Crosswave hands down.  If you have been hesitant to purchase another floor cleaner because the Bissel series was a disappointment, I suggest you give this a try.  Am thrilled with it!

  I purchased the ifloor3 in March. I had seen Good things about it. A couple of weeks ago it started shutting off as soon as I turned it on. I would put it on the dock to clean it but it would shut off before going through the full clean. I have taken everything off and cleaned all the parts thoroughly and triple checked that there wasn’t a hair clog (I have a dog) anywhere. Still no luck. I have called and emailed the manufacture and have not got a response of any kind. Save your self the trouble and just go with the bissell crosswave.

  I have a bissell crosswave at my work and prefer this tineco over that. It has more features, uses less cleaner and liquid and also has a turbo feature. I also love that you don't have to hold the button to make cleaner come our. The bissell crosswave you have to hold it and use way more.

  This does a solid job on wood floors-the roller is soft so doesn't scratch, doesn't use a ton of water to warp wood or anything. Overall very satisfied but really needed this to quick clean up drool spots from our big dog and it takes numerous passes to remove spots.

  Our whole main floor is hardwood and tile. As a busy mom I was looking for a solution to the wet feet (when my kids swear they were dry) coming in from the pool and puppy prints all over my floors.The Tineco mops and dries in less than 5 minutes. So easy to charge, self clean and use. My girls actually ENJOY getting the mopping chore because they know it’s the easiest chore.I generally do vacuum with my Dyson for the two upper floors with carpet, but the Tinco lives on the main floor and is great on my low profile area rugs and the hardwood/tile. Can’t say enough about this product!

  I was a little hesitant to purchase but glad I did. I have bad back problems and have problems using a regular vacuum, much less mop. This is perfect. Very lightweight and easy to use. Only downside is the water tanks are small and have to be filled a little more often than I’d prefer but I’ll take it. Perfect weight.

    Not what I had expected
  
","









  
  
    
  So I've been waiting to write a review. I've had this for about two months now. I have to say at first I was really upset because it was not what I had expected. I thought this was going to scrub my floors and I would finally throw away my dreaded mop. For the amount of money I would at least expect that. But no.What did get me to slowly start to like it was my son had dropped a jar of artichoke hearts in oil on the tile and it went everywhere. I picked up the larger parts and food and decided it was time to really put this baby to the test. I have to say it did impress me. It cleaned up the oil, and small bits of glass and didn't leave the oil residue. I had the mess cleaned up in literally 2 min and I didn't have to scrub anything.  So I had decided to keep it because it is nice to have for spot cleaning and smaller messes, as well as in between mops.With that being said here are the pros and consPro:-For quick clean ups this is perfect. Even if your dog has an accident in the house. ( Which our puppy did twice )- Easy to clean and the self cleaning option is pretty fantastic.- Very light weight and maneuvers very easily.- The vacuum works great but I want to note there is no option for vaccum or mop it's always vaccum and mop.- if you have tile that showed everything on it like mine. This is a great in between moping.Cons- holding tank is super small, the same for the clean water tank. If you are using it on max the water will last you about 5 min.- this is not to replace mopping by any means. This is JUST for little clean up or in between.- the charge does not last long at all. And it takes forever to recharge. My house is about 2800sqft and I do one room at a time in between charges. It's totally horrible and not practical.

  After a little over 2 months this thing reeks so bad. I wash the parts and air dry as the manual states after every use but now every time I turn it on it just makes my whole house smell horrible and I can’t take it. It makes me gag.. It’s as though the parts that cannot be cleaned are to blame. Not only the smell but after 5 weeks it started to randomly turn off and shut down even with a full battery, it has never connected to the app no matter how much I try. Customer service is absolutely non-existent. I called and was told to talk to Amazon about a refund, Amazon states the manufacturer is responsible for a refund. I email, no reply. You get nowhere but back and forth. And for $400 I feel I have been robbed, I just want to return this for a refund I’ll probably never get. Steer clear. Your $400 is better spent on the Bissell Crosswave honestly.

  If you have any kind of shedding animals  - as I do - the vacuum CONTINUALLY stops running and yaps at you to clean out the dirty water tank (Nowhere near filled) and the debris.  Need to stop, disassemble and pick out all the hair.  At the spot you stop and do that it will leak a small puddle of dirty water which then needs to be cleaned up.I would absolutely have returned it the first week, but breaking it down and repacking all those little parts would take way more effort than I'm willing to expend.  I have it for sale on FaceBook Marketplace.

  This purchase would be worth it if the cost was about $50, not $300. If you want it to actually clean a spot on the floor, your need to keep the mop on the spot for 1-2 minutes. The dirty water tank has to be changed 1-2x just washing my very small kitchen. Not worth it.

    Lightweight and quiet but quit after 5 months
  
","









  
  
    
  UPDATE:  quit working after 5 months.  I really loved it while it worked, but have been having intermittent problems.  Time I would asked me to send a video. Well, they just got a video of the machine but sucking anything up.  This was expensive for only 5 months of use.  Let's see how good their customer service us.ORIGINAL: I was a little skeptical about this machine.  I used to have a Floormate, the first lasted several years, the next two lasted until just after the warranty expired.  I switched to Crosswave.  On the first two Crosswaves, the brush motors stopped working after a few months.  Bissell sent warranty replacements.  The next two the suction motors died just out of warranty.  I really loved the crosswave - it did  great job but replacing them constantly or waiting for a warranty replacement became annoying.  The Floor one is so quiet, except for the voice prompts which can be muted.  It doesn't over-wet the floor, and it really does a great job on stuck on stuff that I had to scrape off when using the Crosswave.  It has a water only mode that I love for quick clean up when the dogs come in with muddy paws.  Not having a cord is great, On heavy cleaning days it means putting the machine on the charger between rooms. I was able to do my entire downstairs (a little less than 1000 sq ft) on one charge.  My husband didn't have to turn up the TV to hear over the cleaner like he had to with the Floormate or the Crosswave.  I was able to do out stair treads - I wasn't able to with the Crosswave or the Floormate. Now, let's see if this holds up better the the Crosswave and Floormate.  Fingers Crossed!!

  Piece of junk straight out of the box. The app shows the battery 100% charged. There is also an error message showing that the ""battery in not properly installed"". The battery is installed by the manufacturer. It is internal. I called Tineco customer service per their instruction. I reached a recording stating they were having problems with their phone system and recommended chat. I went to their website. Chat was unavailable. The only option offered was to leave a message. The is a message included with the unit that there may be some residual moisture from testing? Not sure how this could made it through. Amazon's customer service was stellar as always. The vacuum is on the way back for a refund. I ordered a Bissell Crosswave Max instead.

   The floor cleaner is excellent and was a great addition to the house with 2 kiddos. However after 6 months and maybe 20 uses, the cleaner stopped working and sucking in liquid.I also have other tineco products and their customer support is not awesome in that you need to capture videos or photos of the simplest troubleshooting steps. We'll see how this is resolved for me and I'll keep you all updated.Giving 2 stars since it was a 5 start performance until it broke...Edit: After working with Tineco support I eventually got a replacement unit. It took a few emails and a video showing the issue. Given the support and that I like the machine itself ill bump it back to 4 stars. Time will tell how reliable it is going forward

  Cleaned area about 40 Square Ft: Had to refill clean water and dirty water 4 times on auto clean, need to engineer x2 size. Brush does not have any bristles, so cleaning small minor sticky stuff isn't efficient or non existent. So just stand there until it comes clean!  Battery lasted through the floor cleaning and self-clean with 10 minutes to spare. I hope they can engineer 45 min to 1 hr cleaning Time. The 40 Sq ft was a master bathroom, master walk-in closet and a small cat feeding area. I have all tile floor...doesn't do well on the grout.  This machine is a daily or every other day duster with vac and water. Will be shutting off voice to much to many mental interrupts. Absolutely love the cordless!

  Bought both the Tineco machines S3 & new S5. Without a doubt the S5 is much better than the S3. If you need longer clean times, deeper cleanings then the S5 is your machine. The S3 is very good but more quick clean ups. The S3 struggles to clean along side walls and baseboards due to the cover on the mop roller. The S3 is also much harder to maintain and keep clean when compared to S5. We are also having some issues with the S3 machine randomly saying to clean dirty water bin when it has just been emptied and washed. This maybe a one off and defective unit but the S5 has given zero problems. Overall I don’t think either machine will disappoint and both will get the job done. However I do think it is worth spending the extra cash if you can on the new S5 vs saving a couple hundred bucks on the S3. Both machines are well made and quality products. I will update this review in the future to provide feedback on its longevity. We are satisfied with both machines but will be returning the S3 for the new S5.

  I was skeptical at first but wow it really does work!  I figured this was super gimmicky and wouldn’t actually clean the floors but I am pleasantly surprised how well it cleans. I have hardwood floor throughout my home and this vacuum leaves them shiny and perfectly clean- other people have complained about streaks but I haven’t experienced that at all. The suction works great and functions as well as my dyson WHILE mopping. I normally wash my floors once a week so I figured there’s no way they can be that dirty, but the water in this thing was nearly black the first time I ran it. I was in shock.This is definitely a splurge item since you would still need a regular vacuum to do rugs but if you enjoy cleaning/ do a lot of cleaning this is such a time saver!!! 100% worth the money in my opinion.

  I was very excited for this vacuum but I was seriously disappointed overall. Yes, the LED screen and talking is cool but I feel like the vacuum and the materials feel cheap. I was also extremely upset that the battery will die in about 2 years and because I bought it on Amazon then they wont replace it. Also, the app is clunky and kept failing. I also didn't find the cleaning of the vacuum after each wet use very easy. I don't think it really saves me a lot of time when I factor in the factor in the cleaning and the fact that I still have to go back to some areas because it doesnt have a hose.  Therefore this cant replace my other vacuum. For the price that it is it really just isn't worth it for me.

  This is my first dry/wet vacuum so I have nothing to compare to but I’m 100% happy with this. My house is just shy of 2,000 sqft with half covered in hard floor. Clean floors make me feel like my life is put together and I spent a lot of time cleaning them. The battery life is more than sufficient even if I make a 2nd pass. 1 tank of water does the house. The suction picks up everything. Pet hair? Easy. Dry mud from shoes? Gone. Green beans your kid swore they finished? I got you fam. It pulls up all the nasty water and makes you feel some kind of way. Disgusted, maybe. But it’s more satisfying than a Saturday night tinder date and never disappoints. It’s super easy to clean.

  It works pretty good on mildly dirty floors and you just keep going over the same spot till the sensor indicates the area is clean. If you have dogs or cats and there is allot of hair on the floor, the mop will tell you it needs to be cleaned and you will need to clean out the hair every 5 minutes. I suggest sweeping a hairy floor first, and then use the Tineco s3 to mop/vacuum. If you clean your floors often you will not have to sweep. It takes 5 minutes to clean my kitchen, and only 12 minutes for my largest room. I did all of a 1400 square foot vinyl floor and ran the cleaning cycle on one battery. I was able to pick up a big pile of dog barf in two passes. For really dirty floors set the suction to max instead of using the default sensor and you will be happy.  You will have to add water and cleaner to the water tank two or three times for the whole house. The dirty water tank is large and wont have to be changed till you are done. You will want to empty and rinse the dirty water tank or your kitchen will smell like a janitors mop bucket. I suggest taking the mop roller out and putting in the holder on the base unit so it dries and does not stink; it comes off very easy. Update: This come with 2 mop rollers and I suggest using both mop rollers to avoid any stinky smells. After use take out mop roller (very easy takes 5 seconds-really) put it in the base unit which holds it vertically so it dries quickly and doesn't get smelly and put you spare dry roller back on the Tineco. Alternatively when you have only one roller take plastic cover off roller after use and self cleaning cycle so it can dry properly.

  We went into this purchase knowing that a lot of people were recommending this unit but I was blown away by the deep cleaning  capabilities of this wet dry vac.We decided to put it to the test and see if it was all true. We swept and mopped like we normally do. Waited till it was all dry and we ran the iFloor3 and we were surprised to see how dirty the water was once we finished running the iFloor3 WoW.A few things we wished were better is the battery and the clean water tank.Battery: the iFloor3 is small enough that they could have made it just a bit larger and put a bigger battery in it.Clean water tank: again it’s just to small. Needs to be a bit bigger so it has better holding power.I know I know there is a bigger unit that can accommodate but at a much higher price.Long story short WE LOVE IT.

  I really wanted to like this vacuum cleaner.  We have young children that make an absolute mess every single meal and I need something to clean it all up, especially the wet stuff, something better than getting down on my hands and knees with a wet wipe.  I’ll admit that the vacuum works (kinda) but it basically just does a solid job of sucking up a bunch of crap into a really expensive device that is annoying to clean every time you use it (per the instructions.)  I’d say you’re better off getting both the green and purple Swiffers.  Much easier to use and cheaper.

  I could not love this more. I bought this to clean up the floor in a room we rented to our friend and it worked miracles. I literally could not have cleaned the room without it. It is such an amazing alternative to having to either be on my hands and knees scrubbing or using a swifter. It takes zero strength and does a WAY better job. It’s also so easy to clean up. There’s no tricky way of getting things clean, it’s easy and straightforward! 10/10 would recommend for everyone in any household ever. Such a time saver.

  As a first time mom with a baby learning to walk this machine has been phenomenal. It’s easy to use, lightweight, and my floors have never looked so good. I love that I can easily use it while holding the baby. Cleaning up after meals and snacks is no longer a chore because this thing can pick up anything baby decides to toss to the floor. I also have two small dogs who track things in constantly from the yard and now it’s a breeze to clean up rather than having to sweep multiple times a day. Seriously if you are on the fence just buy it!

  Overall the concept is well executed - a decent vacuum  that mops the floor. As a house with only tile and hardwood it’s pretty convenient.That being said, it lasted one year. I purchased last October and now it won’t hold a charge. It blinks on the screen random signs and is basically an expensive piece of trash.I did enjoy the year we had it but at the price point should last 3 years.

  This is an awesome product, but their are some things I don’t like.1. When you turn it off it leaks out water making a mess.2. The water capacity is small, by the time you get going you have to stop.3. The scrub brush doesn’t scrub very move, things have to be super loose and free for it to get it.The machine works well but it’s such a short time before you have to add more water and things, so it’s a pain in the butt.

  It's a fine vacuum if you are looking for something that can do quick and light cleaning. It didn’t work for me because I own a dog that sheds a lot! And I need something that can easily pick up lots of fur.Also I love vacuum and mop feature, but it requires way too much maintenance. Water tanks are so small and you can’t just vacuum, so you have to keep changing water.If you were accidentally drop or tilt the vacuum water would spill inside of it and it would give you error ( + extra cleaning)After each use it needs to be disassembled cleaned and air-dried. And that's ok if you have time for that) Otherwise mopping brash will stink after a couple of days.☹️☹️☹️

  Good quality and it works well. Had some trouble connecting to our dual-band routers, which was frustrating. Somewhat easy OTA firmware updates (if you get around the dual band issue). Diagnostics are pretty cool - it detected a motor failure, but support was great. Turned out to be an unexplained false failure, and everything works fine again now.

  This is hands down one of the best things I have ever bought. I have a lot of hardwood in my home and it’s tiring to vacuum and then mop.

  With all hardwood floors, cleaning tends to be incredibly time-consuming and back-breaking. I really enjoy my Tineco. It's lightweight, maneuverable, and cordless. A capful of the solution and a tank of clean water, and the results in the dirty water tank speak for themselves. This is a great item for cleaning up spills, weekly tidying, and just making your life easier overall.I wouldn't recommend trying to use this item for extensive deep cleaning, but as your everyday wash and vacuum option, it's a solid choice. The charging dock can be kept out of the way and makes sure your Tineco is always ready to go. If you're considering this purchase, it's worth the splurge.

  Definitely not what everyone is saying. I was nearly able to one room (13x16) as run time is about 15 minutes.  Recharge takes take 3 to 4 hours for a full battery. Imagine doing full house clean up. It will take two days at least. Also, dried up messes aren’t cleaned out either. Sure, all looks fine when little damp and shiny. When floors are dried up messes are still somewhat visible. So don’t expect deep cleaning like advertising says. Best to use streamer for such messes.

  I love the product but if your looking for a deep clean this is not it. It gets regular dirt and new spills and messes but it has a hard time getting dried food and things stuck to the floors. Also if you have tile it doesn’t really clean the grout at all it is able to suction the dirt but the water doesn’t really get in to the grout and the brush does not even touch the grout I do think the problem stems from the fact the the cleaning brush carpet texture is not very long and does not get a lot of wiggle room to get the deeper groves of the tile.

  I have two dogs and use this to help keep the hardwood floors clean. Easy to use and enjoy the self cleaning feature. The clean water tank is a little small but the job that this Ifloor does on the floor, I can tolerate having to fill the tank a couple of times if I'm cleaning a big room. The extra rollers are hard to find, but did find them on Ebay. They were out of stock on Amazon and on the company website. Very satisfied with this purchase and would recommend to everyone.

  Product is super easy to use.  Suction is great. I have a small elderly dog who frequently urinates in the house. This has been a god send for me.  No more paper towels and wringing mops.  My only concern is that the cleaning solution is always out of stock, and they tell us to only use their cleaning solution.  I have found one that I believe is similar and am using that.

  This is just a well thought out product.  I've owned other wet/dry floor cleaners but this has been the best so far. Pros: solid floor (laminate) cleaning, cordless with a docking station, and self-cleaning. Cons: clean water tanks and dirty water tanks are a bit small. The tanks are sufficient for cleaning a good size room but have to be emptied before and after self-cleaning. Would definitely purchase again.

  I disliked that the dirty water tank and clean water tank were so small. I live in a small studio apt and I have to empty and clean the dirty water tank and refill the clean water/solution tank three times to clean. I wished it was a vacuum steamer mop, then I wouldn’t care about having to refill and empty the tank. It’s lightweight. Love the autoclean for the brush roller. It’s easy to use and has strong suction power for spilled liquids along with solids.

  Folks, I have two large dogs so vacuuming and cleaning floors is a weekly chore needed because of all of the fur and slobber.  I have 3000 sq/ft of floors with about two-thirds of it a mix of tile and hardwood.  I have tried several types of floor cleaners over the years.  After several weeks of use, I can confirm that this unit is incredible and easy to use.  It has a self-cleaning function making it maintenance-free and easy to live with.  After cleaning about 2000 sq/ft of flooring each week, requiring 2 tank fulls of clean water and solution, the battery is still about 50%.  It really does an incredible job of cleaning with a single pass.  The fact that there is a required cleaning solution that must be used is a minor drawback, but it does smell great and seem very effective!  Still, I highly recommend this unit.

  My housekeeper had been using a steam machine on my floors but a connector on it broke. I bought this hoping for the best and it did not disappoint. The steam cleaner steamed and moved dirt around but did not pick it up. The first two times I this machine the water was absolutely BLACK! As someone else mentioned, my glossy floor was left streaked — the first time. After the initial cleaning there has never been any streaking at all. Now, dirty water is a normal tan color from a normal amount of dirt. LOVE THIS FLOOR CLEANER! I have learned to leave the clean water container empty between use or else it leaks down into the tray below. This machine eliminates the need to sweep before mopping — a real time saver. Works great on my vinyl planking (couldn’t use steamer there). Floor is left barely damp, no puddling.

  Embarrassed to say I saw this machine on tiktok. A woman had all three models and used each to clean an area of a dirty floor. While the floor was still damp she wiped them with a paper towl. The paper towel came back clean after a pass with the  floor one S3. Typically I use a steam mop, but decided to give this a try because I was so impressed.Recently moved into a new home. Hired move in cleaners- the floors looked clean when we arrived. A few days later received the floor one s3 in the mail and I cleaned the floors. I was shocked at what this machine picked up. My husband did the paper towel test and it came back totally clean. Even he said he thought the floors were pretty clean before I used the s3, but there was a huge difference and we were both surprised by what I dumped out from the dirty tank.I give the vac 5 stars with some caveats. 1. Clean water tank/dirty water tank doesn't last long. I have hard floors in dining room, kitchen, living area, and bathrooms. I usually have to fill up twice, if I'm taking my time three times.  2. Battery only last 35 minutes. It's plenty of time for me to get done what I need to, but a larger home may need to be broken up over time. 3. Needs to be cleaned after each use. It's super easy to do, but another task.Overall, highly recommend. Best floor cleaner I've used.

    Works best as a wet scrubber after regular vacuuming
  
","









  
  
    
  So after testing it's medal against the furry mess that my 2 beasts leave in their wake, I have determined it's best to use a regular vacuum first, then make a few passes with this.  And yes, assuming you have pets and children and other messes, it's likely you'll need 2-3 full uses of this to get an area clean.  Meaning scrub, empty the dirty water, fill the tank with fresh, and start over.  It does pick up the dust/hair, but it makes it less efficient at mopping and makes it harder to dump since the hair clings in areas of the mechanism it shouldn't.

  This is 100% worth every penny for a streamlined way to clean my laminate floors. For reference, we have 3 dogs, a cat, and a baby. I used to vacuum daily with my dyson stick, then mop with my O-Cedar spin mop about 2x/week. The main things that I didn’t like about that process was the time it took, the mediocre results, and the fact that I end up using dirty mop water to clean the floor. Now, I vacuum my rugs with my dyson first, then fold  over the edges of my rugs and clean my laminate floors with the Tineco. The only thing is that since we do have two dogs that shed, I have to go through somewhat of an extensive cleaning of the Tineco itself after each use, but I don’t mind it. I just make sure any built up hairballs are removed before and after running the self cleaning. The battery life is sufficient for my home, it easily runs long enough for about 800sqft that we have in hard flooring. I switch back and forth between auto and max depending on where I’m cleaning, this helps it run longer.

  I've owned this machine for a year now. After a year of owning it I can say, I still love it.... When it works. There is something majorly wrong with the charging base and connectors on the actual machine. At about 6 months, the machine wouldn't charge. I cleaned both sides of the receptors with alcohol, as company suggested, but it also has to be in this perfect angle because or else... it won't charge. My routine after using it, is clean the receptors and spend about 5 minutes trying to get it into the perfect angle so it charges and cleans itself. All while the machine keeps repeating ""charging has commenced"". After the money this machine costs, I shouldn't have to do that. My sister in law, who I told to get this machine as well, has had to have hers replaced twice.  I'm a disappointed and frustrated.

  I love this thing. I'm not one for gadgets or the latest greatest fad but I'm sold on this in a big way! I tell all my friends and family they need one. Was recommended to me by a friend and I'll forever be grateful! I can clean my whole main floor on one charge it does a much better job than I could with a regular mop. Saves me so much time! With 5 kids and frequent visitors there's no way I could keep to my own standards without this mop. I have engineered hardwood floors so I just use the hottest water from the faucet and no solution. The Tineco solution is not great for hardwood is what I've gathered with research plus I don't love the smell nor the way it makes my floor look.

  Was very excited and considering the expensive price did not expect it to be as bad. Yes very high tech but the actual cleaning part not very good. I could’ve bought a vacuum for half the price and it would’ve still been a very good vacuum. The reason why I selected this vacuum was for the moping feature and it is horrible, the water tank only gives me to do half the living room meaning I would have to stop and fill it up 8 times by the time I am done with the house and would have to empty the dirty water tank the same amount of times. Again for the money I paid not even the vacuum part of it lived up to my expectations.

  It works okay not bad. I like it, however if you have a big mess or big area to clean, a few things happen, either the “clean brush” sensor comes or you need to dump the dirty water out and refill the canister.  It’s a little time consuming but I think the most annoying part is that it does not do well on corners or edges. You miss a streak of dirt because the brush does not have the capability to get into those tight areas. Overall it’s good for a small apartment with hardwood floors, doesn’t do particularly  amazing on bathroom tile.

  I am happy with this vacuum. It’s my second one. The battery life is pretty good. And the suction power is also good. The only thing I wish is that it got into the edges of the floor or the corners a little bit closer or more. That’s my only feedback that isn’t positive. It’s easy to grab and convenient to use which is a plus!

  Like the design and ease of use to get started. Seems to clean very nicely and easily cleaned up a spilled coke on the floor the other day very nicely. Only thing is cleaning the unit after use is a little tedious and knowing what I know now I’d probably get the middle priced unit because I feel as if the AI chip or whatever that detects dirt is a gimmick

  I have been using my Tineco everyday! I love it, makes my floors shine and I LOVE that my back doesn’t hurt by the time I’m done with the job! Although it is super great to have and use, the only downfall is that it doesn’t reach the edge of the walls.. it has great suction and sucks Debris from the edges just doesn’t mop about an inch away from wall.. I still use a mop or damp rag for edges… It still is much easier then using a back breaking mop! Love it!

  This machine is a beast. Not only does it save me so much time (I can vacuum and mop simultaneously) but it does a much better job than mopping ever could. My floors look brand new when I’m done. I love that it has a self cleaning function, but don’t be mistaken, it still does required you to take a few of the pieces apart and rinse them. The self cleaning basically does most of the job for you but also cleans the internal parts where debris and dirty water could get trapped. Worth the money hands down, especially if you have kids or pets.

  Hands down, buy the tineco! My floors have never been so clean! I love that I can completely clean my floors in just one step and I can actually tell my floors are clean. My house smells amazing afterwards. I have a 1400 sq foot house and I can clean it twice before the battery dies, only having to empty the tank once and refill the clean water once or twice. It’s very simple and time efficient. I was hesitant to spend that much at first, but no regrets!! Buy it now!

  I enjoy the ease of use, great to clean the whole house or quick messes, but lacking on the deep clean that a good scrub can get you. Harder to pick up dirt on tile that has been sitting. Overall better usage for a floor that does not have grout lines as it doesn’t get in the joint like a normal mop would. I do love the product and these are the only things I would change.

    Customer Support, Machine breaks down
  
","









  
  
    
  l would hesitate to purchase from Tineco.  I purchased TWO of their IFloor3 machines.  I loved my first one and purchased a 2nd one.  The 2nd machine broke down within 6 months.  It took me 2 weeks to get a shipping label from them to repair the machine.  Then another 2 weeks to fix it.  I did not test it when it came back as I was starting to have issues with my first machine and wanted to be sure to give them all the information so they can fix it.  I started a claim to have it repaired and thought I better take out the one that they ""fixed"" to make sure it worked good.  My mistake for not testing it as soon as I got it.  It is worse then when I sent it in.  They did NOT fix it.  So now I had 2 machines that did not work.  I called and emailed (first time their phones would not reach a live person)  They promised to replace both machines and as soon as I sent them that they would send me a replacement machine.  Well they are unreachable now.  It has been a week and 2 days since I sent the one machine back and they do not answer any of my emails and I just tried to call and they are not taking calls now.  When the machine worked it was fantastic but if they break down and you can't get them repaired, then what good is a machine you pay $400  for and is wearing out and breaking down in a year?  Or less?  Beware.  BTY, they have an F rating with the BBB.

  Are your kids expert crumb producers? Do the men in your house manage to consistently miss the toilet while peeing? Does the hubby somehow manage to track mud into the house during a summer drought? Do your cats purposefully jump out of the litter box with as much litter as possible stuck in the crevasses his or her paws? If so, this vacuum mop is for you!! No more sweeping or vacuuming before mopping. This baby saves so much time I was able to let my creative juices flow and write this thoughtful review. It even self cleans when the mess is sucked up. If I had to marry a machine- this would be my forever beau. The only downside is that the dirty water canister is small and requires frequent emptying of the contents of shame. I revel in this moment and usually shove said contents into my family’s face so they can come face to face with their filth. I highly recommend this machine and am extremely impressed with the customer service and durability of the machine thus far. Give it a go- you won’t be disappointed…(that’s what she said).

  I love this thing.  Sweep and mop at the same time.  Picks up everything.Advice - Don't just clean the the dirty water.  Pull out the rotating mop/bush from time to time.You can use everyday because it's battery powered and not a two step process of sweep and then mopping.  It won't replace hardcore stain removal of a mop and or brush but if you use everyday, things don't have time to really harden.  You still need a vacuum for other stuff such as couches and carpets but it really is a great tool.I bought mine used off the TINECO store.  It just stopped charging after about 30 days use. Then it worked for a few times and now it no longer charges.  I called Tineco, they went through the obligatory trouble shooting process and then then told me they will ship a label for me to return for a brand new one.  This isn't what I wanted to happen but the customer service and product make we want to excuse this as a lemon.  The customer service is a bit hard to understand in broken English but if you give them a chance, they really mean to make it right.

    Best Appliance I Bought in Years
  
","









  
  
    
  This Tineco Floor One S3 floor cleaner is the best appliance I bought in years. The level of convenience it has added to my daily life is probably only comparable to my dishwashing machine. It does a pretty great job with the hardwood floors and a decent job with tiles. The battery life is enough to cover an area of approximately 1300 sqft.I previously had completely given up on moping because I had to vacuum very thoroughly and then mop. The moping part itself was quite laborious because we have a huge area of hardwood floor and tile floor in the house. Tineco floor cleaner made things much easier by combining moping and vacuuming.The suction power is pretty sufficient even in the low/auto mode. The self cleaning feature is nice especially for the roller part but you'll need to clean the dirty water tank and debris yourself which I personally don't mind doing once in a while.The only shortage of this device is with the tight corners which can be tricky to cover. Overall I've been very happy with it so far (2 months after purchase). I cannot make any comments about the durability yet, hope it lasts longer than some other cordless vacumes I had so far.

  Typically I do not write reviews. Actually, this is my first time. I was at first very spectacle about the product based on reviews and having my Bissell Crosswave for over five years. Regrettably, it had stopped working fully.  I have fibromyalgia and needed something that would do both jobs well. OMG, I was beyond overjoyed as it cleans beautifully and surprised it was self propelled, making it even easier to use. It does the job it’s designed to do. It washes and picks up the random dog hair my two Corgi’s likes to leave behind. Lol. AND, IT SELF-CLEAN it’s self after use. Hallelujah!The best money I’ve ever spent!!!!!!!!!

    Exceeds my expectations
  
","









  
  
    
  Update 01/8/2022:Love the device does a great job. But now after a few months the battery only runs for half the time it originally did. Being not replaceable, I doubt I'll grt much more use out of it. Basically this is a disposable vacuum. Until they make it user replaceable, I can't recommend at all. Lowering rating from 5 stars down to 2...and that's being generous for this waste of money.Well, in short, this device exceeds my expectations. I was a little skeptical. Do I REALLY need this. On the off chance that it addresses my hardwood floor and 3 cat world would be worth it - so gave it shot. Read on for notes. NOT a paid or influenced review.Unboxing was easy. FYI charge fir 4.5 hours before operation so first thing you should do and come back to it.  I’m tech savvy but lots of compartments, buttons, indicators, traps, so best to read the manual before even trying to figure it out. That took all but 15 minutes, then makes sense. On first use seeing it in action all becomes crystal clear and pretty simple (again, after reading manual). FYI, the documentation is actually pretty good.Operation. Very well engineered. All the compartments are well designed, convenient, fit well. Easy to get on and off. Prepping for use takes all but a minute and prepping for storage (need to empty and clean some parts sounds like a hassle but really only takes a moment l, dead simple. Was actually surprised.Using it. Man. This baby really does it. Now I wasn’t going to get the smart model, and I’ll note that you don’t need it. But it pretty much either guides you through use (voice telling you tank is full, need more clean water etc) or the mode has changed, battery, need to do cleaning cycle, etc. It's useful.Also it has auto max/mode where it will sense the dirt on the floor and adjust water and suction. I was skeptical of this working well. But, it works REALLY WELL. I knew where my blind spots from my mopping routine are and it picked those right out like a police lineup! It’s a visual led that’s bright and easy to see that constantly visualizes how clean or dirty the flor is whole moving it over it. You can go full power instead if you want by pressing the same button (that toggles between auto and low or max) but the power adjusts so well and effectively I didn't need to even on heavy areas. Surprised me how well it works.Now how well did it clean? Basically I can eat off the floor. Seriously. I have hardwoods and a spiral staircase going down and can see all the dirt by looking parallel into the floor plane. I can see EVERY speck. After using this, zero. And even got my caked dried out gifts that my cats leave around. I mean otherwise I have to go in with hot water and messy rags. Think about what this does, spins the roller and solvent are super high rpm for you. Some took 10-15 seconds of patiently doing its thing but that was rare only when encountering those spots (which would have taken me more time to deal with otherwise). Otherwise, the rest of the floor was pretty much a single pass forward and beck and move to next pass. FYI, it appears the most effective way to do this is to move it forward and slowly back (the back motion appears to really take alot of the dirt away and suck up the way for a really effective clean and dry). Everything was pretty much a single pass.Also can’t believe a couple of things that I didn’t expect or pick up from reviews:1. Because it suctions that water back in floors dry SUPER quick. Like by the time I am done with the next section previous is dry. Say about 2 minutes.2. Battery. I expected to not be able to do my entire floor (kitchen, living, two bathrooms and a master bedroom). Well, did it all and have 30% left over. They say 35 minutes on auto, I exceeded that and still had a good amount left over.3. I was hesitant about buying this because I thought dealing with water, tanks, dirt water, would be a hassle and frequent during operation. It’s not only simple but only had to refill and empty once the whole tome (so one refill and empty during and then a final empty as I prepped to put away.With manual mopping you pretty much just water down and spread around the grime. Yes, soak some up, but this system really just sucks it all up and not spread it at all. Makes sense for a much better clean. For me, manual mopping is a thing of the past now. I got an extended warranty so Im certain to be on this program for several years.A little bit of a business case. I was using Bona. I go through a gallon of their liquid every 4-6 weeks. I mop my house once a week (with 3 cats need to). Considering that i did my entire living space  (2,000 squft) with only 2 cap fulls of Tineco solvent (capfuls are tiny and get so many out of a bottle) I'll make my money back on this in about 15 months for the price I paid. You get a bottle of solvent with the unit (also extra Hepa filer and roller) so i'm factoring that i only need to buy one replacement of each in that timeframe. So, it also logically makes sense.Although, note, you can’t tip it more than 45 degrees. You can get under tables but not under beds etc so for that I’ll keep the swifter handy but is such a minor trade off.

    Disappointed not as hands-free as advertised

  Disappointed it’s not as advertised as far as clean up of the machine . If you’re thinking that you can run the self clean and leave it go… you can’t, there’s a reason they give you a free screen and roller pad. It’s because if you leave the wet roller and screen (after self cleaning) on longer than a day on the machine there’s a very stinky odor that happens When you go to use it two days later. Even though it’s supposed to be clean.  They need to be removed after you self clean and be put in the holders on the sides and the dry pads be put into the unit. In my mind this is not a machine that self cleans and leaves you hands-free of touching and just emptying bins rinsing and replacing . Not quite as self sufficient as  advertised. And as all these reviews show. I’ve only found one review before I purchased where the woman removed them after the machines self cleaning and thought she was just being extra clean. I do believe it does a decent job on wood and marble floors. ( I just used water I worry that their solution is not good for these type of flooring so I didn’t want to chance it. ) Be prepared for the  extra work after using it each time.  small cleanups will not be something that it  is useful for with this extra cleanup needed.

  This machine is a life saver! We have 3 dogs, one sloppy cook and everyday life messes. My hubby is a dirt/germ freak. He was so negative about spending this amount of money on a Brand we’ve never heard of. Needless to say, he is completely shocked at how good this machine works. He will get on his hands and knees to check if the gritty dust is vacuumed and mopped. We cannot believe how well this machine works. It’s better than any dyson we own. The floors are very clean. It vacuums all the dog hair up too! We have light beige tile and red wine spills and this machine gets it up no problem. My house no longer smells of wet dog because this machine cleans so well. We have hardwood floors as well and they look amazing! The best thing about this machine is the self cleaning mode. AMAZING!  Our home is quite large and we have yet to use the entire battery even when using max cleaning.

    Blows the Bissell Crosswave out of the water!!!
  
","









  
  
    
  I've owned the Bissell CW for 2 1/2 years.  It's the pet version.  I own a lab, and have 3 teenage girls running in and out.  We have 2300 sq ft of tile!  My husband is a truck driver that typically forgets to take his boots off after work.  We also live in Oklahoma, where red dirt is rampant.  I've never seen clear water with my Bissell, I've cleaned over and over again in small areas just to see if the water would ever run clean, and it never did.I first saw the Tineco on TikTok.  Yeah.. que the eyerolls.  But, this lady was raving about the suction power, and ease of cleaning- so I bought it.  Out of the box, it had 2 bars, so there was enough charge for me to try it out.  My floors dry so much faster than the BCW, there is NO streaking, and the dirt it was pulling out of my tile was nuts.  I went over my kitchen 3 times, and water actually ran clear.  I am thoroughly impressed.  Best of all, the self cleaning feature is freaking awesome.  Anyone who buys this will be happy, and impressed.  Thank you so much for actually making a machine that does what it is supposed to do!  There's no looking back now!!

    Never turned on despite full charge.  AVOID THIS!
  
","









  
  
    
  I bought this on Prime Day in June 2021 and never got around to opening it and charging it (there was construction in my house...) until two days ago.  Easy to unbox and assemble and put in charging port.  Within a few hours, it was at 100 percent.  Great!  The next morning I went to use it (followed all directions in instruction manual) and it wouldn't turn on.  It was dead despite having 100 percent charge.  I tried multiple times, reassembled the vacuum (external parts only), checked for blockages as per YouTube videos, etc.  I called Tineco's customer service and only got a recording that said to leave a voicemail and someone would get back to me.  Really?  I did call Amazon for technical support and they helped me walk through even more troubleshooting techniques and still dead.  Wouldn't turn on.  I tried multiple additional times to call Tineco and finally got through to a nice person who told me to return it as it couldn't be troubleshooted and was dead on arrival.  I am lucky that I am within the 30 day return window and will get my money back.  Yes, I got a lemon but it begs the question about quality control.  I rarely write bad reviews, but having read other bad reviews, I just want to warn people to try it immediately when they get it delivered.  I was so confident that it would be amazing based on all the positive reviews that I didn't feel any urgency to check its functionality.  So disappointed because I loved the concept and thought it would be a great cleaning tool.  Returning it and not asking for replacement.  A bad first impression is probably a sign of things to come...

  This thing works! It doesn’t use much water or solution and the water after was almost black. My cleaning lady steams every two weeks but that only sterilizes and pushes around dirt. This vacuum mop picks up the grease and dirt. If Dyson were to make a product like this, this would be it. Cordless and great suction. It’s not designed to rush through the big jobs although I will say if it’s a small spill, you would have it cleaned up quickly. All in all it meets more than my expectations.

  I have found that there is no substitute for hands and knees floor cleaning.  That being said, I hate the thought of having to get down there and do the job so I bought the tinco ifloor 3.  I wasn't sure it did a great job so I did a test.  I did the whole floor, emptied the dirty water, and re-washed the floor.  Unfortunately, the wastewater was still dirty, although not as dirty as the first round.  I used to have the hoover floormate until they screwed up how they manufactured it and let me tell ya, you could eat off the floor after I was done cleaning with it. I'm disappointed.

  This is one of the best purchases I have ever made. I have hardwood all throughout my house and it makes cleaning my floors a breeze. I have a lot of animals and with that pet hair. There was not much talk with this product on how it picks up pet hair, but I would say that this product is NOT good for picking up fur balls due to the mopping aspect of this product, so I reccomend cleaning up any pet hair before using. Other than that it is a wonderful product. The only other downside is that she talks way too much and always repeats to do the self-cleaning cycle, even if you already ran it! I would also say that this product is not great at deep cleaning hardwood floors. It good for wet substances that was spilled on the floor, but not for wet substances that had already dried prior to cleaning. Altoghter the two downsides are not enough for me to not give it five stars, because it still does what it was sold to do.

  Have had it for over 2 weeks and it did start to smell when in use so I started to wonder if maybe the insides will never be truly clean. I ran it through 'self-clean' THREE times and then the 'dirty water container' was no longer gray! It was more of a foggy/murky water. It also pushed out some extra hairs so I highly recommend you do some extra cycles to really get everything out. Make sure to put on some gloves and fish through the hole and brush to get all the tangled hairs. It doesn't smell anymore!

  Product is pretty good. Big downside is that it doesn’t seem bulky until you realize that it can’t get anywhere near corners or within about an inch of walls. It does deep clean, showing me that my traditional mop just wasn’t cutting it.. but it doesn’t do well on dried on spots. So if you’re looking to mop only weekly with this, this might not be for you. This is best for instant spills and wet items. Anything dried I would have to let it sit on the spot on max for over a minute to make even a dent in it. I found it easier to spray the spot first, use a scrub daddy on it, then use this to clean up that mess. Overall pretty good product though. I threw out my mop. I still run my roomba though for the corners and 1 inch wall space this can’t get.

   So I bought the cheaper ifloor3 model and then the upgraded model went on sale so I decided to return the old one and get the new one. They both are about the same size and have the same charging base and tools. However, the newer model cleans at least 30% better than the older one. It mops much better and can get things like dried jello of of the floor. The display on the newer one is nicer but a really nice feature it has that the other doesn’t is that it tells you areas that are dirtier than others and let’s you know when that area is clean. It also alerts you to when the brush is getting too dirty so your not using a dirty brush to mop. Overall I would say it’s worth the upgrade, especially when the price dips around Christmas to 279. The original one was 250 when I bought it anyways.

    More precious than GOLD!
  
","









  
  
    
  This thing is absolute gold. We have wood look tile throughout our downstairs, kitchen, dining room, living room, entryway, and hallways leading to bedrooms. I will never use anything else. We have a five person family, as well as two dogs, and this thing has been an absolute lifesaver. My floor feels so clean walking on it when I’m done using it. While it is pricey, even ask somebody who is frugal and budgets, it was very much worth the price. I use it almost daily and it works as good three months later as it did the first time I used it. Every time I use it the water is filthy… Which means this thing picks up a lot of dirt and grime, and also that we are very messy people LOL.I can clean our entire downstairs on one charge. I usually turn it on super max power when I’m deep cleaning, and the charge last at least 30 minutes, which is ample time to clean all of our tiled space. I usually have to refill the clean water tank at least once while I’m cleaning, but that is quick and easy. Do yourself a favor and get this floor cleaner, you won’t be sorry!

    Non-Existent Customer Service
  
","









  
  
    
  I have had the mop for 4 months and the S3 floor mop was great until it started leaking everywhere. The container that holds the solution and water is held together by glue. The glue is defective it is no longer properly sealing the container so it is leaking everywhere. I have tried submitting a warranty claim and I have tried calling customer service only for their telephone line to say they are no longer taking calls due to a promotion. What type of business stops taking warranty calls due to a promotion? Unbelievable! This mop was too much money for me to just toss my money in the trash. I am so frustrated and very disappointed with this company! Beware when investing in a Tineco product as you are out of luck with using your warranty.

    Best vacuum I have ever used by far!!!
  
","









  
  
    
  I love this mop a lot! I have 3 kids, 2 dogs that shed a lot, and a cat. This cleans my whole downstairs and only takes 20 mins. It sucks up allll the hair and cleans the floors wonderfully, then you look over your shoulder and the floors are dried already it’s amazing. I brought it to a friend for her kids bday party and she ended up buying one as well because she was so impressed with it. It pulls you when your mopping which makes it so easy on your back. The self cleaning feature is amazing unlike other vacuums I have had no hair has gotten stuck around the brush. I will say for us it isn’t fully self clean the hair will clot up after self cleaning so I have to take apart and pull the hair out of the 2 spots it gets stuck in but it’s way easier then any other product I have tried.The only two things I wish was different is that I wish it had a small attachment for the hand it would be sooo handy to have that for like tables and stuff. The solution lasts forever. There is no strong smell or residue left behind.The second thing is I am always on a tight budget and I always look for a coupon I searched and searched and never found one. Now a week past my eligible return date and coupons are all over. I bought this as a Mother’s Day gift for myself so I am really upset that I missed out on that. If you get this wait for the coupon. Then buy yourself the extra rollers and filters with it.Please note take out the rollers everytime after you self clean or it will smell.

  I researched and researched after seeing comparison videos online. I tried to talk myself out of it, but couldn’t. Living on a farm and having 2 kids, 2 dogs and a cat our hardwood and tile were constantly needing to be cleaned. It took so long (sweep, microfiber broom, vacuum, mop, steam mop, Bona clean) and by the time I was done with the last room and clean up you couldn’t tell I had cleaned anything. This is a time saver and has saved my sanity. It isn’t a replacement for those every few months super deep cleaning (hand scrubbing) but for every day maintenance it is beyond perfect. My floors have never been cleaner.It’s also not loud. I run it when my youngest naps without fear of waking them. Seriously, just go ahead and buy it.

  I absolutely love this machine!!! It does a great job and leaves the floor feeling so clean! It is very convenient with being cordless, having the base charger, and self cleaning mode. There are still a few steps to make sure it’s all clean but nothing major and is quicker and simpler then cleaning up after a mop and bucket. There are still a few places that I use my mop for like around the toilets, under the lip of the fridge and stove and under a few large pieces of furniture but I don’t need to pull it out as often as I did. The Tineco has taken the place of my broom and mop 90% of the time. It is a must for parents and pet owners!! I have a Newfoundland that sheds all the time, a small dog that digs and tends to track in dirt, 5 children who are in and out all day long, 2 of which are under three and commonly get more of their food on the floor then in their mouths! I use this thing multiple times a day!! The dry time is quicker then when mopping and the floor comes out so much cleaner!!

  It did amazing on our hardwood floors.It's maiden voyage was cleaning up after a big family get together.  After all the floors, it was still only down to 60%  I'm happy so far but, it has only been a week, I'll try to update again after using it a month.  My only complaint ""It talks to much!""  Update: Months have passed, it works great, still using the original bottle of cleaning solution. I've gotten used to the talking, it keeps track of fluid levels for me.  Also, let it do it's ""self-cleaning cycle"" after use then, rinse it before storing back on the base. Works Perfectly, Every Time!

  We just changed our flooring to premium vinyl floors,  the Tineco cleaner is a lightweight workhorse. After our flooring installation, the floors looked pretty clean. I cleaned the whole house with the Tiineco cleaner and was amazed at how much dirt was on the floor, the water was filthy. The floors looked fantastic and smelled great after adding the Tineco cleaner that was included with the order. I wish the battery lasted a bit longer but it charges fast so not a big deal. Very easy to use, easier than pushing a self-propelled vacuum cleaner. Highly recommend.

  I absolutely love this vacuum mop! It cuts my cleaning in half and it's super easy to use! I use it on all my floors! There are two reasons I didn't give it a 5 stars. One the cleaning tool it comes with is SUPER HARD to open. I just keep it open now because it's impossible to grip and open which is not a deal breaker. Just annoying lolSecond and my biggest annoyance is it does not get edges. It leaves about an inch along the sides it may vacuum some stuff up but the mop for sure doesn't reach it so you have to wipe the edges yourself. I've tried many ways to get to them and it just doesn't reach the entire floor!I love how easy everything else is and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product! Just needs a tad bit work ☺️

  Honestly so disappointed i cant believe people are raving about this vac/mop ! I have to change the dirty water tank  so frequently it’s ridiculous this was supposed To save time not add more work.

Also randomly sprays water droplets from god knows where doesnt clean the floors too impressively And im looking at other people’s pictures and we definitely have a different mop.

  Can save you time! If your floors are relatively clean you can mop floors faster than mop or spray and have much cleaner floors. Larger cleaning tank and longer battery life needed. It will pickup dog hair but this will slow you down having to dump dirty tank more often so I sweep first. All said I would consider this just a faster and more clean way to mop rather than a vac.Update: My cleaning tank had slow drip leak due to a failed seal. See attached pic. I have contacted Tineco support and they are sending warranty replacement.

    Almost perfect!
  
","









  
  
    
  I have two cats, a 2 year old, and a 5 year old. This vacuum/mop not only picks up everything it also CLEANS the floors. My normal routine was to vacuum then steam mop and this achieves the clean I want in one run. I have very long hair that sheds and the brush roller handles it like a champ and doesn’t get tangled up. The battery makes it through my living room, playroom, 2 bathrooms and kitchen. (I do have to empty the dirty water tank and refill the clean water during this time) The self clean is what makes this officially worth the money! Not having to worry about this stinking or getting nasty after cleaning my (nasty) floors is a relief. My one and only complaint is that it misses about 1/2inch on the side, meaning that when you clean against a wall it is unable to get the very edge. Otherwise this is perfect.

It doesn’t leave much though.It’s very maneuverable, when it is running. It tends to pull when the brush runs.It does leave streaks. Not a deal killer to me but it does.It’s easy to clean.

  Loved the idea of an all in one (mop/vaccum) but with 2 dogs who shed constantly this is constantly getting clogged and running the self clean is not enough, it leaves a line of water on the floor if you don't constantly clean the dog hair out of the roller and debre channel. The roller and dirty water tank needs to be removed and washed after each use I'm finding. Which is a lot more work than it should be for a ""self cleaning""machine at the steep price that it is.

  So I had been debating on one of these since around Christmas. I had a bissell crosswave pet pro but I just wasn’t really a fan of it. I sold it the day after I got the tineco because it is AMAZING. My floors actually feel cleaner after using it. The suction power is great, the machine almost pulls itself while using it. The cordless & self cleaning is a total game changer. And it’s so easy to clean out afterwards. The only negative thing I would say is that it doesn’t have the full side reach, it leaves at least a half an inch gap but that’s really not a big deal. If you’re debating, GET IT

  I have enjoyed having this go to tool for cleaning my hard floors.  I replaced most of the carpet in my home with Vinyl Tile a couple years ago and keeping it clean has been time consuming.  I can pull this out and clean all the hard floors in a fraction of the time it took to sweep and mop the floors.  Also, I have a dog, so sweeping dog hair is an exercise in futility.  It just floats around in the air.  This tool picks the hair up and traps it, so no more chasing flying fur balls.  It does take more effort to clean, but not much more than cleaning all that dog hair off my broom and mop.  Very easy to clean, but there are a couple steps to keeping the dog hair cleared out.

  I LOVE this vacuum mop.  However it’s been leaking since I got it.  Somehow the seams of the plastic cleaning solution cup has a crack or something and it leaks.

Called the number and left a message but received no call back.  I would give this all 5 stars if I could get the parts replaced, but alas, the vacuum lasted one week before breaking and it’s becoming too costly to replace the cleaning solution so often in order for it to work.

  Bought this when there was a small discount available during Prime Days. I was on the fence about it because it is still so expensive. But i told myself if it didn't absolutely wow me on day 1, i would return it for a full refund. Just used it for the first time and I am definitely going to keep it. We have a tile kitchen and then wood floors throughout the rest of the house. Sweeping and mopping the kitchen, then sweeping and delicately cleaning the wood has been such a hassle. This cut my floor cleaning time in half (or probably even by more) and picked up dirt significantly better than sweeping. After the first use, the water I dumped was basically black and the floors looked great.It is much more expensive than I am comfortable with but I think its worth it because its going to make life easier and give me more time to spend with my family. I'll pay a little extra for those benefits.The big con i noticed is that it was hard to use on my tile steps. I will probably keep the swiffer and mop for that area.

There was no troubleshooting on the call, and they did not offer to replace the defective unit. If they decide to provide me with a shipping label,  I will then have to repack the unit (in a box I provide.

  I was skeptical about spending this amount of money for mopping, but it has been one of the best investments!  I HATE mopping, and this has made the process so much easier.  No nasty mop to ring out, no nasty bucket of water...ugh!  I debated between Tineco and competitor, but after researching, decided to go with this one.  Felt I was getting 'more bang for my buck'.  If you have more than a small area to mop, bet this!  My 2100 sq ft house only has carpet in the 3 bedrooms, and I can mop the whole thing in no time now.  Also, the fact that it dries quickly, doesn't give my 3 furbabies a chance to leave their prints.

This works well on laminate flooring, hardwood, and just about everything but carpet. While there is a little water left behind, even walking on it does not present any slipping hazard or track the dirty footprints that you are used to.

  In a household with 5 kids your floors can get dirty fast. I grabbed this highly recommended machine on a prime day sale. This little machine can clean up supper crumbs and spills in a jiffy. The majority of my home is hardwood and it cleaned then all on the normal setting. Used the max a few times on a few areas. Had almost half of the battery life left. This thing would be great in beach condos and campers. The self cleaning function is great! Hopefully it last as it’s my new favorite gadget. Will update after a few months.

  This vacuum is awesome. I can do my whole apartment and still have 80% battery power left. The canister is not very large so I do usually have to empty it and refill the reservoir before self-cleaning, but I love all the features this vacuum has and it makes my floors so clean. The canister IS large enough to hold all of the water for vacuuming my apartment, just not for the additional water used in the self cleaning.The cleaning solution also has a nice clean scent but is not over powering. The bottle has lasted me quite a long time

    Fails too often
  
","









  
  
    
  Nice design, nice price but it just fails too often in real world situations and usage.  Suction power is decent and it does a pretty good job sucking up the water so that it leaves your floor relatively dry.  But the downsides out weigh these positives.  Downsides being:-  can't really handle moping up any normal amounts of food.  It'll clog it up asap-  even when I ""pre-clean"" the floor so there's no solid waste on the floor, the unit will still stop and display the ""Channel has blockage"" error message.Hope their customer service can do something about this.  I'm still under their 2 year warranty.

  This does the job well. The suction is very good. It sucked the dirt right out of the little crevices between the wood slats. Very easy to clean up. My only complaint is that it is hard to find the Tineco brand cleaning solution. I don't want to use any other cleaning product, but everywhere I look the Tineco cleaning solution is sold out or out of stock. Very disappointing.

  First, I loved this product when I seen the results of my floor without having to break my back.The downfalls: doesn’t take long before I have to clean the dirty water tank, no big deal I found a way around that.Approximately 25 minutes to use, kinda sucks, but I can get my house done in that time too.The ultimate reason for my rating: I got 2 full uses max and my Tineco does not work! Will not charge! Doesn’t self-clean and let me tell you I made sure I read the directions and followed through with everything correctly before I even used it. I’m discouraged cause the money spent feels like a total loss when I could have used it elsewhere.

  Bought based off of a recommendation from a stranger on Facebook. I have 1000 square feet of hardwood/ tile floor with 4 cats and 2 messy children. I HATE THE TIME IT TAKES TO VACUUM AND THEN MOP. mopping kills my back. this little machine is AMAZING!!!! My Shark pet vacuum is great with its built in light, i wish there was a light on this fella, but it does it’s job and then some. I will still vacuum with my Shark, just because I want to ensure that I’m getting everything... but my mop and bucket are GONE. If I’m doing a quick vacuum I use my Tineco. I love this machine. So much. Worth every dollar.

    We have white floors and 5 dogs

  We are a family of 6 and 5 little dogs so our new white floors get dirty fast.  At first, we weren't too sure of this vacuum.  Even after reading all the reviews and seeing testimonies on social media.  We just installed white tile. I got it out of the box and attempted using the Tineco.  After using it, the floor still looked dirty.  My husband thinks it was still residue from the grout even though we had used a Swifter numerous times since installing the floor this summer.  So we ended up hand washing the floor.  After handwashing, I usually use the Tineco Ifloor3 at least every day or every other day and it seems to take up the day to day dirt pretty easily.  I still think we will need to hand wash our floors at least once a month, but this will be used for day to day dirt. The first picture is after one dog coming in side the second picture is after maybe 2-3 minutes of cleaning.

  So I need to start this review by saying my nick name is CCD because my friends say I have a compulsive cleaning disorder. So you can imagine what I thought when I took the the first picture and saw how much dirt came up in just one small sect of my floor. I never write reviews and I just had to write one for this product. It is light weight so easy to use. It cleaned my supposedly clean floors so well that my husband noticed. If you are mopping your floors like I was you are basically just moving the dirt around. This machine is AMAZING. It is worth the price.

  So far, Love it!  It is very easy to use.  Cleans my floors beautifully and runs a long time on one charge.  Have used it twice and am glad I bought it.  It has a very uniform cleaning path with no excess water left on my tile.  Area is dry within 2 or 3 minutes.  A full container of dirty water is proof of its cleaning ability.  Cordless is a beautiful thing.  Cleaning is very simple.  You do need to remove the roller brush and rinse and wring but the overall cleaning is much less than compared to other cleaners.  I've had a Bissell for years.  It was time for a new one.  Glad I saw the Tineco before buying another one.  Only thing I would like to see is a roller with a little brush bristle action to scrape the sticky smudges off my tile easier.  With the softer roller it takes a little longer to get them off.  I basically run over it and leave it wet a few seconds and hit it again.

  Update: after having it a good bit of time, if you have a heavy traffic home, the limited time you have before it dies. Just not worth it like I thought. Cleaning awesome, but being cordless and only having about 35 minutes of cleaning… just is not what I’m looking for.I have 10 dogs, and so the amount of dirt and mud they bring in, plus the random mess... I have never been soo happy to have a vacuum! It saves so much time and money. Instead of having to do a three step process: sweep, vacuum, and mopping. To do it with just one thing... I will definitely be buying again for the rest of my life! The down side of it is the battery life, and how long it takes to charge. But how good it works, I can look past the lack of time the battery can last before being put back on charge. Nice not having my back hurt from mopping and sweeping, just one fluid motion! The tougher stains go over slowly. It pulls up everything!

  Great Vacuum and Mop. I have tried many different ways with hand mop, steam mop, iRobot, but this purchase of mine is a life saver. You get the satisfaction of a clean hardwood floor instantaneously. With small kids around and food dust and always on the floor, made me feel exhausted with first vacuum it and then run a mop to get a clean feel. This vacuum mop is definitely a good purchase in so many year. I have also use it on the carpet and it does a pretty much good job, while this is exclusively meant for hard floor cleaning.I would definitely recommend to a person who wants to get the basic cleaning of floor quick, and always like to have a clean mopped floor, have smaller kids and also the area like 1000sqft or less.

  I am obsessed with this thing. Makes cleaning up the floor after a messy toddler eats dinner a breeze. The suction power is awesome and based on the color of the dirty water, I'd imagine it's doing a good job cleaning my floors. My dad even walked into my house the day after I first used it and said ""the floors look brighter."" It moves super easily and does not leave a ton of water behind on the floor - it dries quickly. For reference, we have linoleum tile in the kitchen and bathroom (that is generally hard to clean because it's textured) and wood everywhere else on the first floor and it does a great job on everything. I love that I can wash my floors every day without it being a hassle.

  While the idea of vacuuming and mopping sounds like it will cut time, it really doesn’t with the Tineco.The problems I ran into are:25minutes continuous run time is not sufficient time to clean a 3/2 1600sqft house. Reasons why: this vacuum doesn’t fit under dressers, bed, and other room furniture. Therefore, you have to move things out the way. When the vacuum is in stand positions as you move furniture out the way, it emits dirty water. Further making more cleaning. This vacuum/mop is probably more useful as a quick clean up because someone is coming over and not useful for deep cleaning.

  This machine is AWESOME. I have a Dyson vacuum and it doesn't even compare to the suction power of this machine plus it washes the floor at the same time. It s just my husband and myself in our house and I thought I kept the floors pretty clean....guess not because the dirty water was BLACK. It is light, easy to use and the indicator lights letting you know you need more water or to empty the dirty water tank are easy to see. I had no problem with hair wrapping around the roller, it all went into the dirty water tank.  Highly recommend and well worth the cost.

  I wanted to use this product for several months before submitting a review. I have very furry dogs that shed and also bring in a lot of dirt especially when it rains. My first purchase was a pet bulky hard floor vacuum and after a few months it smelled when I would use it and wouldn’t pick up a lot. This vacuum was twice as much $$ but after my first use I was blown away. Here I am several months later still loving this machine. It’s easy to use and clean considering I’m pretty lazy when it comes to cleaning out vacuums. I love that the pieces are hard acrylic plastic, all you have to do is rinse it out. The cleaning solution it comes with is unscented but it really cleans muddy paw prints on the tile. The Max feature is great. The only negative thing I can say is the battery life. So I start with one or two rooms clean it out and let it charge and then I go to the next room. I recommend it.

You spend so much money on the pads and cleaner. When I got the Tinceo ifloor3 vacuum/mop. I went over my living room 3 times befor the water was black. And I thought I thought my floors where clean. I have never had SUCH A WONDERFUL PRODUCT. When the time comes I will buy from them again. For the record I did my research on these. Yes others have larger containers but are all so bulky. This is a new company and I STAND by there product 100%.

  This thing is ridiculously AMAZING! I have hardwood floors and tile in the wet areas. We have two dogs and two messy little ones, I’m talking dog hair everywhere, toothpaste smeared on the bathroom tile, little spills constantly making the floors sticky.  This thing picked it ALL up. My floors look brand new. It’s self propelled and lightweight. Easy to push around and kind of fun actually. It tells you when to redock for a self clean. You do have to manually empty the dirty bin but it’s not hard. I’m so glad a friend recommended this to me. I love this more than the bissel cross wave pet pro (and I’m not sponsored to say that). The only thing that could be better is battery life. I have 1900 square feet to vacuum so the battery was flashing by the time I was done, but it never actually died.

  I absolutely love this product. I’ve always had a swiffer sweeper and felt like that did the job until I bought the tineco. My floors have never been cleaner! It’s very easy to use, just put water and soap in it and turn it on. You can set it to run full blast or auto where it decides when it needs a power boost. No button to tilt the body like a vacuum cleaner, just hold the head still and pull the handle towards the floor. Gets into tight spots very easily. It will practically drag you across the room if your not prepared. It does require some frequent cleaning but it also does that itself for the most part. Just keep up on changing your water and cleaning the dirty water chamber. I had linoleum, vinyl, and laminate plank flooring and it does wonders on all of these.

  I had high hopes for this. I have all hard surface floors, 2 kids and a cat, and lots of messes. For stickier things like sauces or other foods I still have to get on my hands and knees to clean it. It’s like the roller doesn’t have enough pressure or force to actually clean things. I would compare it to using a swifter wet jet and just gliding it over a mess and expecting it to clean.

  UPDATE** completely unusable now. Less than 6 months from purchasing and receiving it. Super disappointed. No suctions, shuts off after 2 seconds of running. I’ve had issues since day one but this is ridiculous. For this amount of money that was spent it should last ATLEAST A YEAR. Contacting them tomorrow for hopefully a remedy to this upsetting situation.Previous reviewI don’t feel like it has the greatest suction but not the worst. Cannot reach the creases and corners by any means. Other than that it’s not bad but definitely not worth 300$.

  Its fun to do and to only have to go over the floors once is a timesaver. I was amazed at how good it cleaned.  What I would like is a bigger tank container, as my floors are large and can't do in one passover without refilling a few times.  Also although it gets off most of the grime now and then a tough brush that you manually lower would be a helpful add for future models.  All in all I have never had a all in one mop and and most happy with the results of this one.  You do have to keep it charged so storage in my pantry without an outlet was problematic.  I have used on low carpet runners, tile and limestone.  Love the fact I'm not pushing around dirty water.  Recommend

  I bought this machine with bit of skepticism, but looking at Tik Toc reviews, I decided to give it try. I am so glad I did. I always did two things separately, vacuuming and moping, but this does both at once. Also, the wet moping dried pretty quickly and compared to my old Hoover floor washer. I was so pleased that I bought a second one for my parents.I wished the vacuum had more power for suction, but doing the wet mop simultaneously, beats all other machines doing separately!

   I WANT to like this product so badly. When it worked (the first couple days) it was wonderful and I loved using it. I properly cared for it after every use, cleaning the dirty water tank, debris channel, and leaving the  brush roller out to dry overnight. Within a few days it gave me this message: “Please restart or contact customer service” to which I immediately did.  I had already contacted customer service the first week of ownership and they walked me through how to restart it over the phone. That worked for a couple days. Then the message returned. At this point my unit is only 1 month old, and it’s such a pain to keep contacting customer service. They now say I’m pass the 30 day return window, but that they can repair it for me. I’m extremely annoyed and disappointed as this is an issue I’ve had since the beginning, and there is record of me contacting customer service the first week. Now I’ll have to see how the repair service goes. I can see this would be a great product IF it worked…but for now my experience has been very disappointing as I had saved for awhile and was looking forward to using this for quite some time.

  If your swaying on the fence about buying because of the price, bite the bullet.. well worth the money. I bought the top one with the bells and whistles. It mops and vacuum's at the same time. Cleans itself, and is so light. It takes off by itself so there is literal no pushing this thing, it will take you with it lol. Just a cap of the solution and it’s a small tank, I have 1500 square foot home, the solution lasts for the cleaning and do not have to refill. A bigger home might need a refill before finishing the floors. Wish it had an adapter for short rugs, I have vacuumed/mopped with this over my short rugs and no issues, not sure I recommend it(because it wets the carpet)  but it got my dog hair off of it hahaha anyways

  I LOVE this floor cleaner! I recently installed LVP in my entire 2,000 sq ft house. I can clean my whole house in about 45 mins- hour.  Previous to this, we were using a machine with cleaning pads on the bottom that just kind of rotated in circles, no suction. That just seemed to move the dirt around. I am amazed at how well this cleans and sucks up all the yuck! And it doesn't leave a ton of water on the floor, they dry pretty quickly. I do have to refill and empty the tanks about 3 times if I am cleaning all my floors, the tanks are rather small. But that is ok, because it makes it easier to carry around. I love that it is cordless. Buy this, you won't regret it!

  I love love love this for cleaning our kitchen floors. It is perfect for the constant messes my 1 and 3 year olds make. It’s wonderful for the post meal messes and end of the day clean ups. Does not work well on dried stuck on messes. I would not recommend using this as a replacement for deep cleaning. I still need to scrub tile grout to effectively get it clean, but does work well for our wood and LVT flooring.The maintenance of the water tank is easy. However, if you do not stay on top of it the tank can get stinky. I would also proceed with caution when using in bathrooms. Our 3 year old son is potty training and frequently gets urine on the floor, the tank can take on a urine smell.Overall, recommend and wish I had this when I was feeding my babies in their high chairs.

  My son and daughter-in-law have one of these and we tried it out on their floors. Most of these type of cleaners never live up to their statements but I was so impressed at how well and quickly it cleaned their floors, we had to buy one for ourselves. We have hardwoods and tile in most of our house and previously I hated having to dry mop the floors then use “several” swiffers to clean the dirt. This machine has cut cleaning time at least in half, gets pet hair, dust, dirt, crumbs etc.. off the floors then stores the dirty mess in a removable container. It’s battery operated, doesn’t soak the floors (the solution drys quickly so it doesn’t ruin hardwoods), easy to clean dirty water and even cleans itself when it’s returned back onto the charger. It’s more expensive than other similar products but well worth its price. I’m pretty sure it’s made in Japan not China and of high quality. I haven’t been paid to write this nor do I have any connection with this company but had to write this review so at least everyone knows how good this product really is.

  I scoured the internet for this!

If you had a ton of shedding, it’s just more stopping you’ll have to do to clean the machine... but it does pick it up!It is insane the amount of dirt this picks up! I love it! It’s so easy to get off the charging station and run if my dogs ran in the house with muddy paws. Quick few swipes and then back on the charger!Worth every penny!

  First off, I am not endorsed or associated with this product in any way at all. I'm just a normal mom who decided to purchase this product.We have four indoor dogs, a toddler, and my husband works outside all day.  We also have gravel and mud outside.I am absolutely amazed at how much time this saves me.Perks:*Lightweight and almost self-propelled*Quiet*I can sweep and mop my entire house in about 10 minutes.*Easy clean up (I literally set a timer and it took me 3 minutes and 54 seconds to clean the machine after I was finished).  The machine also self cleans, but I make sure to clean it very well after cleanings.*My floors feel cleaner longer.  You know how your floors feel ""extra clean"" right after you mop them when you walk on them with your bare feet?  That is how my floor feels the entire time between cleanings.  And I'm talking a week or two between cleanings.*Floor literally dries in no time.*Solution provided is non-toxic and will last you for SEVERAL cleanings. One cap full equals a cleaning.Complaints:*The battery life could last longer. I am able to complete my entire house with one battery.  This includes our kitchen, hallway, bathrooms, and mudroom.  People with larger houses may not be able to complete a full cleaning on one battery.*There is a gap between the edge of the wall and where the machine cleans. Maybe about an inch. Despite this, the amount of time it saves me and the simplicity of it all is worth it. If you were on the fence about purchasing this, do it! It has made my life easier, saved me time, energy, and space in my small home.

  I loved this for the first few weeks! It mops fairly well, and hardly leaves any wetness behind. It took off some stubborn sticky spots (toddlers...) without me having to bend over to scrape at it myself. The vacuum function is nice as well, although it really doesn't function as a vacuum well...we have pets and definitely couldn't use this as our primary vacuum. It's still nice to have the feature to clean up the bits that get left. The self clean is awesome. You can really see how much dirt it cleans up.All that being said, it was giving us a motor error at one point and it said we had to call customer service. It was not sucking water back up, just leaving a big pool of water. They only operate during normal business hours which was difficult for us as we both work. One time I called no one answered. I did not have a chance to try calling again, but after leaving it unplugged for a while and trying it again (which we had done before but not for that long) it started working and has worked since. If that's just a weird fluke problem it's not a big deal, but given that we had only had it a couple weeks it really worried me and gives me hesitation about recommending it. I do really love it though.

  We've been watching this floor cleaner for a while now and bought one when it went on sale for $280. We have 3 dogs and hard floors throughout our house. This thing is infinitely easier to use than a Bissel Crosswave, easier to clean, and gets the floors cleaner. The auto sensing feature seems hit or miss to me but just letting it run on auto does get the floors clean quickly and easily. It's truly amazing how gross seemingly clean floors actually are. If you actually care about your floors being clean, not just appearing to be, I highly recommend picking up one of these, especially if they're on sale. We only have a 900sq ft space to clean and it runs down to about 50% battery after getting it all cleaned. So on larger houses may have to do a few rooms then recharge and do the other rooms later in the day or the next day, but it only takes 20 minutes or so to do 900sq ft including refilling it and emptying the dirty tank.

  I received this and the very same day used it.  It was very easy to set up, and was packaged very well.  Everything is self explanatory.  I liked the faint smell of the cleaner, I am not one that has to be overpowered by a cleaner to know something is clean.  Loving the fact that it is self propelled, I have a disability that makes using appliances such as these hard.  The display showing when something is still dirty was very helpful, and made me realize how dirty my floors were.  To be fair I have a teenager, and 3 dogs in the house.  The dirty tank was quite impressive and easy to clean.I would highly recommend this to anyone that needs to cut down on their time to clean, or that has a disability and needs to have their home clean with less work.I will say that it not getting right up to the baseboards is not a deal breaker for me, for some it may but the area is not all that large and easy to get to with a mop.

  I got this for Christmas and used it a couple hours after opening!  I cleaned  5 rooms and a long wide hallway area in just minutes!  So easy to set up, use, and clean up after!  I was worried I wouldn’t like that have to clean it after use, but the process is really so simple that a child could do it.  No trouble at all considering how much I was doing prior with a large mop bucket to be rinsed and the mop head to be cleaned before storing.  Our home is pretty big so pre-sweeping and/or vacuuming before mopping doubled the work.  This makes it all super simple.

  Update on my #tineco for all who keep asking....  at first I didn’t like it was honestly thinking of returning it. Kept telling me it needed to self clean very quickly and then once u self clean it uses most of your water and fills your dirty tank up. So I was constantly stopping to clean re-fill and dump. Customer service is also very hard to get in touch with as well. Once I finally got a call back from cs they told me the self cleaning starts blinking during cleaning as a reminder to clean once you’re completely done with your floors if it needs to self clean during a cleaning it would shut down. So once I learned this I’ve been cleaning with no issues. Battery last longer than expected (I was going to get the S3 because longer battery life but this one does fine) now I haven’t cleaned my floors at all this week because I’ve had cabinets getting installed, counters being installed, plumper here hooking stuff up appliances being hooked up. So many people in and out. So today I cleaned because I couldn’t handle the dirt anymore and here are my results as embarrassing as this is.... it worked so well with the amount of dirtiness going on, paper, paint, etc all over my floors. It’s truly a time saving machine (this vacuum and mops at the same exact time) the only thing I’m not fond on is cleaning the roller after each use because if not it will begin to smell.

The fact that this will sweep AND mop is amazing! It saves me so much time and helps me know when I use this im actually deep cleaning, because it will tell you when there is a spot that needs more attention and it will adjust the suction power and the amount of water it uses. It sweeps, mops, drys, and has a self clean mode. This product is absolutely amazing!

    Didn't impress. Leaks dirty water
  
","









  
  
    
  I was so excited about this and willing to spend that much money but was very disappointed. My first observation was that it doesn’t really clean the floors well even on the turbo mode. I had a drip of dirty water on the ground that could’ve been easily wiped up and I had to pass over it so many times to get it cleaned up. Then I realized how fast the battery dies so I feel rushed every time to do three rooms before it dies. Meanwhile I’m having to empty the dirty water canister and refill the clean several times because the canisters only hold a tiny bit of water. Each time you empty it makes a mess, even when you’re careful. They didn’t make emptying it easy and it leaks so much dirty water as you take it off the vacuum. Once the canister is full and it shuts off it leaks more dirty water on the floor (as seen in my picture). Overall I’m just really bummed I spent that amount of money on something that creates more work than it saves. I feel like the videos I saw of it before buying were not accurate at all.

    DOG MOMS DO NOT BUY---IF YOU HAVE KIDS, YES!
  
","









  
  
    
  We have 3 dogs (2 mini Aussies and a corgi mix) and lemme tell ya---they shed like a SOB. I decided to give this vacuum a try because of all the hype. For OUR situation it is not ideal. The fan blows near the bottom so before you can suck up the hair it blows it around the room. The roller is a soft terry cloth material, it needs to be more abrasive to grab dog hair. Also, the dirty water tank got clogged within the first 10 mins of using it. Sorry, its just not made for pet owners.IF YOU HAVE KIDS and no dogs that shed---you are gonna love this. It performs amazing to clean the floor and suck up dirt or stuck on gunk. We do not have kids, only dogs so this isn't great for our situation but I would 100% recommend this for parents with young children.The machine overall is sleek and easy to use. It took minutes to set up and was even charged enough for me to try the day I got it. I wish this worked out but we just need a regular vacuum so we are going to pull the trigger on a Dyson.

    Sooooooo Much Better than using a sponge mop!
  
","









  
  
    
  I fired this baby up yesterday.  Absolutely no buyers regret on my part.  It pulls up a lot of dirt (I have 3,000 s.f. of tile flooring) - you can see the filth in the dirty water tank.  We've sponge mopped the floor for years.  Last month our granddaughter was here - 11 months and still crawling - and I was embarrassed at the dirt on her clothing at her feet and knees - and I had just mopped the floor before she came. This gets up more dirt, for sure. Well engineered.  Easy to maneuver. Lightweight so easy to pick up. simple operation.  simple refill, dump and has a nice self-cleaning feature.  Still, I have taken the roller out for deeper cleaning and it was easy to remove and reinstall. All the technical specs they advertise seem accurate: charging time, use time. Easy to set up right out of the box. Easy to understand user manual. It gets under furniture - AT LEAST the first 6 inches if not more depending on the ground clearance, etc. I have never had a power mop before, so nothing to compare it to besides the sponge mop. But they have lived up to their reputation and advertising as far as I am concerned.

    Thorough first time using it review, not bias, and would recommend with kids/dogs!
  
","









  
  
    
  Good: It tells you when it's still dirty, shows red- even when you can't see it and the light turns to blue when it's clean! It does a great job cleaning, moves itself, and is light weight. It also has a strainer so the dog hair and yuck will seperate from the dirty water when dumping down the sink drain 👍Bad: I ran it (100% charged) in the dining room and when I was almost done it was dead, I had to charge it again to finish. I'd rather it have a plug in option. It doesn't get into small crannies, I wish it had an attachment. It goe a small piece of dog food stuck into it and I didn't notice, so the roller stopped rolling and sucking up and water flooded my floor. If your tiles aren't exactly flat (whose laid tiles are?) It will miss spots. I also wish it had a larger tank for both cleaning water and dirty water- I had to refill about 4x on my dining room alone- granted I did do the max power that way it would get it really clean the first time using it. This may have contributed to the battery power not being so great as well.Ultimately I would recommend purchasing this, especially with kids & dogs! I feel like its reassuring that I'm getting my floors cleaned and I'm not having to scrub super hard to do so or carry buckets of water back and forth. I am (surprisingly) excited for that next little milk spill I usually freak out over because I think for instances like this it will be fantastic! I hated spending this much on a mop, but I do love how clean it got my floors! 😁🤗This was my first time using it, so I don't know about durability or longtivity of this. Or even about cleaning the machine/filters/rollers!

  Pros: lightweight, powerful, self propelled, well made and nice looking. I have 3 kids and 2 cats.Mopping my floors can be backbreaking but not with this! It’s actually fun to use. Do not buy this to use forspot cleaning or everyday. This is like a 1/2 times a week process. This doesn’t replace my broom or handheld vacuum but it does replace my hardwood mop and it does get my floors really clean without any residue or buildup. The fluffy head thing picks up all the dust and cat hair really well and even stuck on spaghetti sauce.Cons: cleaning the tank and the filter can be tedious but necessary and I’m done in 60 seconds. It won’t pick up a lot of stuff in the corners so I have to sweep first.I had to manage my expectations with this and accept that this is not so much a vacuum as it is just a really nice and easy to use mop. It’s not something I would use everyday either. After using it for a couple months I don’t regret this purchase at all. I love it and my kids like to use it too vs an old fashioned mop so that’s a nice bonus.

  I waited a few months before this review so that i could give the best opinion. My neighbor recommended this and I love it! Easy to use, easy to clean, works great and uses very little water and cleaning solution. I have 3 kids and two dogs and my floors have never been cleaner. I can clean my whole house on one charge and only filling it up once. Im able to clean the kitchen, walk in pantry, hallway, bathroom and living room. I have a good size house. Its not as loud as a regular vacuum either so I can even do my floors while the kids sleep AND the sound dont scare the dogs. Definitely recommend this vacuum to everyone and people who might have trouble doing tasks around the house. My elderly mother is disabled and this is easy for her and my 7yo to use as well.

  Absolutely a life changing machine, I have to compare it to my corded Hoover, great machine BUT the cord drove me crazy and it is very noisy , Hoover does have cordless but much more expensive.So this is what I love in this machine1- it is a great weight  it feels like a well made machine, it is made out of all plastic even the filter.( rinse and done )2 you will feel the power and it does have two speeds so if you need  a little extra work.3 - the machine puts out the water and it is just enough to wash the floor but it will dry very quickly.4 - so easy to clean that it is ridiculous press 1 button and walk away then empty the little bin .5- the machine is very quite and very easy to use .In all honesty it is a great buy

  I’ve only used it once but so far I’m happy and impressed! Between sweeping and mopping, it was an hour long exhausting chore to clean floors. This cut it down to half an hour with a lot less effort on my part. I have a back injury so mopping wasn’t easy, this glides itself along and is much better on the lower back. Our floors get so dusty so I was tempted to give something like this a try. We have a pretty big house with hard floors and were able to get it all done right when the battery ran out. That included moving moving couches, chairs, rugs, etc.. We cleaned under everything and did four bathrooms and the amount of dust and dirt it picked up was a night and day difference than my broom and mop! And that was on eco mode, have not tried max yet. I read that the battery lasts longer with eco. I’ve never had a swifter and bristle crosswave so I cannot compare brands but I’m very happy with this. It’s easy to use and clean after you read on how to do it the first time. And no water streaks! So happy about that! We got the $299 version.

  Did not suck up pet hair. The hair would gather around the brush and the machine would randomly spit out big balls of fur. The machine puts out water automatically, so you have no control over how much water is used. I don’t feel the machine sucked well, it left my floors very wet. Due to this my floors ended up streaked. I do not feel this machine is worth the high price.

I attached a picture my floors where I cleaned and where I didn’t. This was ONE pass. It has no issue with dog hair and has great suction to dry water quickly. It is great for deep cleaning, my floors FEEL clean! My back doesn’t hurt from trying to mop. The self cleaning feature is nice, but it does have a few parts that need to be manually cleaned and dried every so often, but WELL worth it considering the trade off of mopping... the cleaning solution is not that expensive and you use such a small amount, the bottle should last for at least 50 tanks.

They sent us back a completely different (not new) machine that was disgustingly dirty! It had rust in different spots, it had dirt and debris on the roller, in the dirty water tank, etc. Within a month of having his “fixed” machine. We start having the same issue. Called the company and they will only “fix” this issue.

  Two things you should know....First, I am a clean freak and second I never write feedback.  But....when I first used my Tineco on what I thought were pretty clean floors and the water came back BLACK, I knew I had to write this review.  Usually, to sweep and mop (twice) my hardwood floors takes me just over an hour.  With my Tineco, it took me less than 25 minutes and my floors are so much cleaner.  As a busy working mom of four, this is a game changer.Kristen B

  I had the Bissel Crosswave Pet Pro for 4 months and was no satisfied with how much dirty water was left after using. I passed it along to a relative that wanted it rather than throwing it in the trash and ordered the Tineco S3. Tik Tok definitely convinced me of the purchase, and they were highly accurate. I have used many times now and am impressed more and more each time. The ONLY thing I wish was that it got a little bit closer to the walls, it is not the end of the world. As it leaves a small gap, once a week I just get my spin mop and clean the edges of the floors. All in all, I have recommended this to many of my friends, family, and coworkers. I will never go back!

  I'm still giving this a 5 star because it does get up a lot of dirt and doesn't leave the floor sopping wet unfortunately because I did want to watch my family bust their a**. What I wish I knew was if you have pretty messy floors (not like hoarders but more like rugrats) it can get backed up fast and require a cleaning. I do love how well this machine it seems like it gets a lot of dirt up but at the same time there are some things it just struggles with like picking up cereal but i expect to much in life apparently and getting crusty applesauce off hardwood that my 1 year old thought would be a hilarious challenge for me indeed he was correct it was pretty funny watching mom get on all 4's to scrub the floor after using her new $300 fancy vacmop.

Well the suction was not strong at all when it was working, and now after only a few months of having it, it broke so it leaks dirty water all over my floors. My whole house smelled like mildew for days after I used it. Really unfortunate considering the price. Not worth it IMO and a much cheaper vacuum could do a much better job. Really disappointed.

","









  
  
    
  I was first very disappointed in this vacuum because it does not do that great of a job vacuuming. But it is a pretty cool mop. You no long have to mess with annoying mop problems with this. Im also rewriting my review because last night my kid flooded the bathroom. Water was flooding into the hall. And i was able to clean it up with this vacuum.

  I have had this since March and every since about June it has had a god awful stinky water smell every time I clean my floors now. I’ve cleaned it after every use and even cleaned the inside and replaced the roller brush and filter. I cannot get the smell to go away and I’m sad I only had it for 60 days before I had issues. Don’t plan on buying another one because now I feel like it’s just a waste of money. I wouldn’t recommend.

  I feel like I received a broken unit, I would order directly from the company instead because I’m 100% sure I received a lemon. It didn’t work from the start sadly. I tried to return it but ups dropped it back off at my house for some reason saying it was hazardous material

  I actually liked this product but the only thing I didn't like is it's suction power wasn't strong enough for trash in corners of the floor. Also, I think this vacuum/mop is good for everyday use, but I still had to use a regular mop for deep cleaning the floors. But overall it's a great product.👌🏾

  Have fallen madly in love with this vacuum. Possibly my best purchase ever. Have three little kids and tile floors. Needing to sweep twice daily. This picks up EVERYthing. And the mop portion just makes it even more beautiful. People walk in and say ""wow, it's so clean in here"". (It's not. It's tineco vacuumed 🤣)

  I'll start by saying I'm a mom of three kids 6 yrs and younger with a stressful full-time job. Most of my Saturdays are spent cleaning my house and I'm always looking for faster, better ways to clean to get some time back. I have a 8 month old baby who is crawling and putting everything in his mouth, so I have been obsessive about my floors. In the past, I was sweeping, vacuuming, and then mopping my whole house, but I hated the idea of dipping the mop back into the dirty water. I was eyeing this machine for a while, thinking it could really help make my life a little easier, and I finally decided to purchase it.This Tineco machine is LIFE CHANGING. My floors are cleaner than they have ever been. I used this machine at least once a day, sometimes multiple times a day. I have a 2000 sq ft home with all tile, wood, or laminate, and I can clean all the floors in my house on one charge. The suction power is awesome and I love the fact that the dirty water goes into a separate tank. Here is a list of pros and cons I think are important to consider when purchasing.Pros- Dirty water goes into a separate tank- Good suction power- Cordless and lightweight- Can easily clean the entire machine, including the roller brush and roller brush cover- The machine tells me when I need to refill the clean water tank, clean the dirty water tank, and clean the machine-  Self-cleaning feature- Easy to useCons- Clean water tank is small, I have to refill it at least 3 times while cleaning the floors of my entire house- Cleaning the dirty water tank is a nasty job. I'm glad it's in the tank and not my floors. However, the tank has to be cleaned multiple times while cleaning my floors. I wish it was big enough that I only had to clean it once after each floor cleaning.- The brush is soft, so it's good for protecting hardwood floors, but even the max clean setting will not remove stuck on food or other stubborn gunk from your floors... you'll have to pull out the mop for that.- It obviously has its limitations. You won't be able to use this machine in tiny areas, like behind the toilet.- Fully charging the machine takes several hours.Overall, I would HIGHLY recommend this machine. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 for two main reasons listed in the ""cons"" section; small clean and dirty water tanks, and the machine's inability to clean stubborn gunk off of the floor.I hope this review helps you make an informed decision.

    Best floor machine I have ever owned.

  Most of my house is tile flooring. This machine almost glides itself. So easy to use. I read some of the other reviews about setting up the app for it. I am a senior and not really good at computers. One of the reviews said if it doesn't work start over and read the directions well. My first  time it didn't work, so I started over and realized I missed a step. So by reading it slow I was able to set it up correctly. So happy with this machine. Very cool technology.  Thank you for making such a cool floor machine.

  The bissell crosswave is getting a ton of hype right now and seemed like something I NEEDED. Not only for easy clean up with dogs and kids but also to be easier on my body to cut cleaning time in half and not have to use so much “elbow grease”, which often triggers tremors/spasms in my hands/arms.I had it in my cart even after reading some mixed reviews but decided to read more reviews on other sites and watch YouTube videos comparing etc etcI quickly removed that thing from my cart after seeing countless reviews and videos showing how fast it breaks down, it leaking, not sucking up the excess water and so on.Then I found this guy and mostly all reviews were extremely positive. Even one helpful YouTube video where the guy had THREE bissell crosswaves (because they kept breaking down and leaking😳) before he got the tineco floor one s3 and said it was far superior in every way.I bought it immediately.This is by far the best cleaning device and everyone with kids and pets needs it 🙃I just mopped a couple days ago and this thing picked up so much dirt and hair and overall nastiness it made it seem I hadn’t mopped in weeks. So satisfying 🤣It is extremely easy on the body too as it is self propelled and has suction comparable to a dyson.Oh and this thing is completely stupid proof, it tells(literally talks) you exactly what it needs and how to do it. You can mute it if you want but I’d rather it tell me it has a clog in the hose because of massive amounts of dog hair so I can quickly sweep it out rather than have a bigger issue later (ahem, bissell).Yes, it costs more. But if the reviews are any indication, I’d rather spend a little extra on something that lasts and works even better.

  As many others have stated I am not one to typically leave reviews on something. This product right here is 100% worth it. When my wife originally started talking about getting one I thought there was no waaaay I was okay with paying that much money for a vacuum mop. I mean who has ever heard of such a thing. I just didn't see where it could be worth it. To keep a long story short my wife's parents bought her one for Christmas. We both couldn't wait to see how it would do. (Her being truly excited and myself wanting to see it flop epically) I have to say I was ultimately let down. (But in a good way) As she was cleaning the house with this thing there was hardly any water left behind (I thought to myself this little money box was not worth it.) However when I saw the dirty water in the tank  and how effortless it was to use my opinion changed. Annnd it self cleans? Whaaaat?? So as it turns out I like the little thing so much I brought it to work with me to show it off to my boss and try and convince him that I needed one to clean up our office floors. Our just came in today and it has not let me down. I have all ideas that my boss will be buying one for his home now. This is a must have item in my opinion for any home or office that has hard floors. I highly recommend this item!

    back saver
  
","









  
  
    
  This cordless floor cleaner is a back saver. My first floor is almost all wood, mopping and drying it is a back breaker. Takes a about two hours to complete. Now with this wonderful floor cleaner it takes me about 30 minutes to an hour. It cleans and then sucks up most of the water and what is left behind dries in a couple of minutes. Everything about this floor cleaner is easy, filling the container, emptying the dirty water, taking the roller brush off putting putting it back on and returning it back to the charger.

  I have used this product for a few weeks now. I have to .edium sized short hair dogs that shed like crazy! I LOVE this tineco! I've never had a wet to dry before so I cannot compare it to other models. This makes cleaning floors incredibly easy. I will say that if I wait too long in between uses that I have to empty the dirty tank half way through because of the hair! I use twice a week and it is a game changer. The suction and maneuverability are comparable to my shark hard wood floor vacuum. The only thing I wish this had was a light on the front so you can see in dark corners! Overall I would definitely recommend.

  I really wanted to enjoy this, I did. I bought it because my friend uses it and she has two or three dogs, two cats and two kids so she used it every day. I bought one for myself since I clean everyday (no seriously, I vacuum and mop everyday). I followed the directions of using a capfull of their cleaning serum with warm to hot tap water but it didn't the oils from human and dog feet off the floor. We have near black hardwood floor so it shows anything regardless but still, it allows me to see what is and isn't cleaning deeply. I also was a little sad that it couldn't clean edges. But its super easy to clean, operate and charge and the self-cleaning mode is super awesome!

  I love everything about this product,it does what it's made to do and that's clean my floors. I have hard ceramic floors and this machine glides across it and cleans it with ease. If you buy one just add a cap full of cleaner that comes with it and water, then turn it on leave it on Auto and just let it clean for you. Afterwards dump out dirty water put more clean water back into machine then set the self clean mode on, the roller with spin at high speeds on the base then just dump the dirty water out and that's it. super easy and simple!! A++ 5 stars I love it

    Game Changer

  Yes it’s a Game Changer!  Just on the time it takes to clean our living space alone is worth the cost of this product!  For maintenance and just day to day clean, we can’t be happier!  The self roller clean is so well thought out and the ease of operating it, I am glad to forget all the steps we had to go through in a traditional mops.  It’s hard to imagine not having this in our lives now that we have it.  What it seems took half of the morning to clean our tile floors once a week was a chore.  Now a quick 10 min is all it takes to keep your home looking great on a day to day bases.On the real though; to get close to perfect clean corners it’s best to do a periodic deep clean on grout and around toilet bowls.  For us a good hot dry steam mops quarterly is probably good practice.  I really wanted to throw out our sweeper and mop however, we chose to keep our mop just for utilizing it in tight areas or when using bleach and for cleaning bathrooms around the toilet bowl.  We kept the broom only to shuffle rouge crumbs.  No we threw out the broom!We’ve used other liquid cleaner like Mrs. Meyers because we like the scent keeping it to just a cap full.

  Had the Tineco for over 6 months. If you have dogs, this is the device you need,. It cleans well, takes little time or effort to clean 1000 sq feet. Works well on hardwoods and area rugs. Self Cleaning also takes care of of that mess as well. I purchased this over the Bissell as Tineco seemed to be a company more directed towards more advanced engineering and software --- and the software automation of the Tineco is pretty darn good.

  Probably the best purchase I've made for our new place. We have engineered hardwood flooring and this is so easy to use we run it every day. I hardly use my regular vacuum. It maneuvers easily and feels like it is self propelling. I was having a hard time prior to this with vacuuming then mopping but has cut down our cleaning time significantly. The water tank is small so I do have to refill it once while doing the floors downstairs. The battery time is theoretically limited but I've never ran out of battery life while cleaning.

  I LOVE this thing.  I have a dog and a baby crawling all over my floors so I use the iFloor3 everyday on my hard floors and it cleans so much better than a regular mop.

  This saves so much time when cleaning!!!!! I don't regret buying this at all. I do think it needs some upgrades though. It needs a more powerful suction. You can't get right up against baseboards, it should have a stronger suction so you can ensure it picks up everything. There should also be a way to use it without ""mopping"" and it needs an attachment.

    Best wet vac ever
  
","









  
  
    
  I love this wet vac. Instead of vacuuming the floor then mopping it, you are able to do it all at once. Plus you are not just pushing dirty water around you are sucking it up leaving a clean bear foot happy floor. Cleaning fluid comes with it and does a great job. It does most of our 3200 sf home on a charge. Cleans up area rugs as well. I empty the dirty water every time I need to refill the water with cleaner then I flush the dirty water down the toilet. I do clean the vacuum completely when I am completely done with vacuuming. It is easy to maneuver and not at all heavy to push. I absolutely love this vacuum!!!!!

Using it is almost effortless, and the self cleaning feature makes clean up almost the same. Just empty the tanks, and all the debris after it’s finished self-cleaning and you’re good to go. I’ve added a video of it cleaning up the breakfast crumbs my boys left behind with EASE. I would pay any amount to own this, but compared to other similar vacuum/mops, this one is a STEAL!

  I have had this about about a week, and I was in love immediately. I have been looking for a quicker way to keep our vinyl plank floors clean as we are a busy family of 7 living on a farm. This has been the ticket. It is very easy to use. I feel it cleans well. It is easy maintenance. I love the self cleaning feature. I use it 2-3 times a day. When I first started using it my water was very dirty. Now when I use it the water is about half as dirty. Kids walk in with muddy boots I just run this and all clean in 30 seconds. I run it around the table and kitchen after meals. If there is a lot of big debris I will sweep, otherwise this amazing machine seems able to handle the rest.

  If I could give 0 stars I would. This “vacuum” does not vacuum. It just spreads water and dirt around my floors. I can’t believe all of these positive reviews! I may have gotten a defective machine, but it is awful. Even in the self cleaning mode it did not suction! The base of the unit filled up and overflowed onto my floor. It left my floors a total mess. I am returning the item. Buyer beware!

  I have laminate floors and at first i was very excited because tik tok sold this so hard on all the great things it can pick up. I love that it mops at the same time as vacuuming, but the thing just isn't what its advertised to be. in videos it picks up cereal and syrup and has no problem getting up pet hair. I used it in one moderately sized room and had to empty or declog the machine three times. I don't think it's meant to keep up with two dogs and four kids which is very disappointing considering the price I paid for it and the skyrocketing of price that keeps happening. Frankly I'm just disappointed.

  We have two dogs, a cat, three kids and two adults in our house and this machine has been great for us.

  I’ve had this for a little over a month now and it works amazing on my hardwood floors with a puppy! I thought I kept my floors clean but the tineco proved me wrong! However, DO NOT leave anything in the dirty water chamber or forget to rinse out the spinner on bottom or it will smell awful. Let dirty water container soak in bleach overnight and left spinner in bowl of mr clean cleaner and that got the god awful smell out.

I would recommend though for those who have pets, to just use your regular vacuum before using this. The pet hair can cause a bit of a mess when cleaning out the machine and can also clog it in certain spots. My only complaint is that it doesn’t get close enough to the wall as I would like, which I knew before purchasing.10 out of 10 would recommend this to anyone with hard floors.

  This wet/dry vacuum is better than I ever could have imagined. I was telling everyone about it and then found out that they were out of stock. Everyone I know is waiting to get one of their own. It cleans my floor so well. It vacuums up any crumbs and scrubs the floor at the same time!  To top it off you then set it in the charging station and you can then hit the button and it will clean itself. You can see it getting the ""mop"" clean.

  I purchased the Floor One S3 to clean the 2800 sqr ft of tile in our home.  The unit takes a bit to get set up and charged and the CWT/DWT clean&dirty water tanks are fairly small requiring them to need refilling & dumping often.  Additionally the clean up process takes 15-20 mins each time the machine is used, however all of this is acceptable, as is the cleaning performance.Unfortunately the dang thing stopped working after the third use.  It will run for apprx. 3-5 secs then it stops and the power indicator flashes.  The instruction manual that came with the unit indicates that this ""problem"" is a ""motor malfunction"" contact customer support.When one calls their well hidden CS number the message over the last 4 days I've called says they are experiencing ""tech"" issues with their phone service and they are working on it.  If you hang in there you will actually get someone in the Philippines, once again.  The last person I spoke with this morning 5.29.20 had a dog barking in the background, which made the already difficult conversation more difficult & FRUSTRATING!!!!!WHEN it works the cleaner does a good job, but like others, I have found dealing with their customer service to be a 1/4 star at best.Buyer/s be ware.

  There are so many things about this product that I love and yet so many that I hate..Firstly it mops and vacuums.. how can you not love that time saving technology??Pros:Light up display for ease of useEasy to move/super lightweightSelf-cleaning roller!!CordlessCons:The dirty water bucket fills up fast and it’s not the easiest to cleanLeaks dirty water when sat upright even when the dirty water level is lowThere is about a 1/2 inch - 1 inch margin around the edge of the machine that does not reach the wall.. so anytime you clean against a wall or piece of furniture, you’re going to have to come back and clean that margin by handFor me the difficulty cleaning the dirty water tank and the margin when trying to get close to a wall were enough to send it back. I love the idea so much though that I am going to be shopping for another. I will say that this is far better than any bissell equivalent.

  UPDATE: customer service reached out to let me know that the representative handling my claim quit her job and did not pass my claim off to anyone else so it sat in her inbox with nothing done for over a month and no one knew it. Whether this is true or not, I am unsure, but they made it right either way and PROMPTLY shipped me a new one to fulfill their warranty service… THANK YOU and I’m thrilled to have my mop back. With 4 dogs and 2 kids, I NEED IT! Hopefully this one holds up!!I LOVED this product until on month 7 of owning it, it threw a code and refused to work. I called customer service, as there is a 2 year warranty and she was helpful…offered a few troubleshooting solutions and when those didn’t work, she stated the motor was shot and they would send me a replacement immediately.  AWESOME! I thought…i am going on week 3 with no mop and no replacement! TINECO wont answer their phone lines and will only respond through email every few days or so.  They sent me a return label to send mine back (after 2 weeks of waiting) but i live in a rural area and the nearest fedex location that will take large packages is over an hour away… the initial customer service agent stated they would send my replacement immediately and now i am being told they will try to get it shipped once they receive the broken one back…they are not interested in helping me, despite me telling them that i have NO fedex locations within an hour drive of me.  I am out a mop, over 300.00 and countless hours dealing with this! DO BETTER TINECO!! I just want the mop that I Paid for!

  I'm going to be honest here, I have 5 kids and work 3 jobs, if I can minimize my cleaning efforts I would, but I bought this device on prime day at $100 off, I thought that was a steal! It took nearly 3 weeks to come in, the clean water tank had water inside, and no cleaning solution came also the box had a cut out which I believe was from a previous send, I emailed the company about this but decided to still try the product, I charged it bit it kept showing the tangled icon, after further inspection I saw one of the clips was broken! They definitely sent me a refurbished product that wasn't even refurbished properly for $200, I sent a return through Amazon and I am hoping the new product they send me is worth $200! I hope this was an honest error and will update this review as soon as I receive the new one! Thank you

  I didn't know I needed this mopping vacuum until I bought it on an impulse buy but now I love this thing... Is this what it means to be an adult and be excited by the most trivial things??First of all, this vacuum is QUIET!!! And I love it! And I know it's a lot to believe that a person is claiming affection for a vacuum but yes, quarantine did that to me... Don't judge me. It's easy and lightweight to push around.. Even my mother who's 65 with two bad hips was able to use it and it didn't scare my dogs either cause regular vacuums are the devil and they have to hide from those.But anyways it's been 9 months with this vacuum and we have the kitchen, living room, laundry room and hallways that are all laminate and tile and this vacuum cleans all of that on about 1 1/2 fills of water and solution.Vacuum itself glides like butter around the house happily cleaning any spills and sticky residue with no problem.It only needs a cap full or a small amount like that of the cleaning solution for each fill and doesn't leave the floor wet, just a little damp and dries in like 3 minutes. Still using the cleaning solution that came with it at this point so that's awesome.Cleaning and emptying the vacuum is super easy and I'm not exaggerating because it's seriously just press two buttons, empty dirty water and rinse.If you have any hard floors in your home and hate the single use waste or tiring arm workout of a Swiffer or regular mop then just treat yourself 2021 (or whatever year) and get one of these. It's one of the few things that are expensive and actually worth it.

    AlfaBot T36 Vs Tineco ifloor3
  
","









  
  
    
  I purchased the AlfaBot T36 fist , after using for 2 weeks I had no issues at all and it would make me laugh, it talks and says when your done to clean dirty bin or gets stinky , lol , the only thing is it’s not self propelled and can be a bit of a work out , then tineco3 went on sale 100 off on Prime Day with its self propelling so I gave it a try , big mistake , yes I can do the hole house with out arm getting a work out but it’s issues almost had me throw it out , first does not hold enough water and it’s dirty bin constantly have to empty with only 1200 square feet , second it clogs all the time also does not clean near walls , huh what’s the point edges don’t get clean it can push dirt around , muddy dirt at front door plan on running it’s self clean a few times and sometimes it clogs doesn’t turn off then just pushes the mud around , have to clean dirty bin take the roller out clean the clog , then rewash the floor , would not use as a vacuum for it’s always clogging , third I have problem putting the water and dirty bins back in most of the time , 4 it’s computer is crazy not letting me use the self cleanings, 90% of the time I have to keep taking them back out and in till it works. Also does not clean as well , I do have a tineco vacuum I like but this was a mistake , only reason for any stars it’s self propelled though it’s computer and clogging issues almost had me throw it out , I guess if you baby it and conform to its needs then you may like it but the alphabot  puts a smile on my face every time yet this tineco3 gets me upset every time , it has an issues every time I use it , the alphabot no issues and put a smile on my face every time and anyone around that hears it talking though it is a bit heavier cause it can do more has larger bins easy to take out and put back and not self propelled was a pleasure. Wish I could return this tineco3, I threw out it’s box because of all the positive reviews and my tineco3 vacuum works great , maybe the top of the line model works better though the way the water and dirty water bins you have to click in perfect or it don’t work is enough for me to not even want to try it and the clogging issue , if you like this you don’t know any better that’s all I have to say it’s just a status symbol and a terrible one at that, I constantly have dirty water puddles on the floor from it clogging and when it cleans it shuts off after putting water on roller 5 times before it starts working water leaks all over there , this tineco3 is more work then something that just works all the time like the alphabot with a smile , it’s been about 4 months now with the tineco3 and the aggravation had me right this review ,it does not clean good a specially near wall or corners .  I know tineco can do better , it’s like they never tested it in real world just made something that looks good , the alphabot blows this away in every aspect but self propelled, it’s a bit louder for has more suction, it’s get the job done ,

  Anyone who says this is high maintenance never mopped on hands and knees. This is a beast of a wet mop vac I love it it’s worth every hour I spent researching for the perfect model/brand. Get this one.

    Great product but short battery life

  This ifloor 3 works great and I really like it. My floors haven’t been this clean in a long time. My only complaint is the battery life. You only get around 30min. Also the clean water tank and the dirty water tank could be a little bigger. I love the self cleaning mode. Works wonders! With the battery life this is perfect for smaller jobs.

    Not worth the money
  
","









  
  
    
  I really wanted to like this, but overall it was a waste of money. It works ok, but is such a hassle to clean and dry after using that it negates the benefit over just mopping separately. You have to completely disassemble the product after each use which is such a pain. If you want it to get up sticky messes you have to go over and over and over again on the same area. Not worth the money at all.

  I can’t say enough about this amazing mop. We have a chocolate lab who shed like crazy!! I use it without using my normal vacuum first and it gets everything up. I also dropped a entire tub of oxiclean on my floor and in two pushes it all came up. I knew I would love this! I’ve had their normal vacuum for over a year and love it also. Also the self clean option is amazing no dog hair or smell left behind on roller

Easy to clean, water tank is small but lasts a long time. Water comes out filthy when cleaning the first time and clean the second time so its working great! Highly recommend!

  After 3 months, the machine stopped working completely. Request a warranty and they wanted me to send it back for them to ‘fix’.

This product is way to expensive to stop working after 3 months and for them to not be able to just replace it… it’s just too much of a hassle.

  I just got it and used it for the first time yesterday and todayPutting it together was very easyFilling tank and start cleaning super easy.Light weight but sturdy.I was a bit worried about the vac due to living by a river and tracking sand is a alwaysIt surprised me it did good.The cleaning was good, some spots you had to go over a few times  but not bad.It didn't put to much water out on the floor it really did goodOnly 2 things so far that bothered meThe tanks are small and you have to stop cleaning to empty the dirty tank rinse refill cleaner tank.  But if it had bigger tanks it would be heavier and I like it that it was light.I bought the middle one I didn't need the voice activation but it had a longer battery lifeThe first time I only did 2 rooms but I was also learning how. today did a lot better made it to kitchen, living, long hall, and  bath, it lasted longer then it said.I will still need to clean around my base boards on hands and knees but this will help me keeping up with the sand and I sweep almost everyday and mop once or twice a week and this will work great,I hope this helps and I will keep trying to update

  Added: Months later, I’ve been having issues with this mop. Randomly, it wouldn’t start. I would turn it on, it would spin and then shut off but the next time I’d try it would work. Cleaned and took care of it according to the instructions. Well, today, it did it again but this time would not turn on past that and started dumping water everywhere. I looked up the troubleshooting for it and tried for 30 or so minutes to figure it out but ultimately ended up coming on here to figure out how to fix it. I saw that I was eligible to return it, thankfully. I’m so appreciative of Amazon and their return policies. It really protects us consumers who spend a fortune on products. This mop was THE BOMB, when it was working. But I took great care of it and it’s unfortunate that it just stopped after less than 7 months with it.Returned my crosswave for this as so many others have! Worth it! This thing is amazing! I use it daily! Functional, easy, cleans well!

  I don’t like to clean because sweeping take 15 minutes and mopping takes 30 minutes!!! But having this machine cut 45 minutes to 20! And lemme tell you… before trying this out, I had actually swept and mopped to see if there was any difference. The results was shocking. The water in the bottom compartment was as black as my ex-husband’s soul. I couldn’t believe my eyes. If you’re on the fence about this product, don’t wait. Check it out IMMEDIATELY! ESPECIALLY if you have kids or pets!

    Nice machine But stopped working after 4 monhs

  This machine is nice but it stopped working after 4 months. The water no longer comes out to mop the floors. The “warranty” process is TERRIBLE!!  I have gone round and round with them and their so called troubleshooting. They asked for a video and pictures of what the machine is doing. I’ve sent all of that for them to tell me to make sure the clean water tank is full. I’ve been messing with custom support for over two weeks. Now, I have to send my machine in and wait for them to repair it. If it’s anything like their customer service, I’m sure it will take months to get it repair. I have to find a box to pack it in and take to a FedEx drop off. Don’t waste your time with this overpriced piece of junk. Now in order to clean my floors, I have to go and get another floor cleaner while I sit and wait for then to repair it. They need to figure out a better process for the warranty on these machines. For the amount of money they are charging for these machines, customers shouldn’t have to jump through hoops to get their machines fixed and to be without machines for an extended period of time because if their slow process. A warranty on a Hoover machine is so much smoother and faster. Should’ve bought a Hoover.

    Decent product, when it works

  Pros: vacuums and mops at the same time. Leaves floors pretty clean, gets up a lot of messes.Cons: It doesn't get to the wall/baseboard, so it leaves a dirty area (where the crumbs like to go) of about 1/2 inch around everything. Hair easily gets tangled in it. And if you don't have time to take it apart and clean it thoroughly after use, it smells HORRIBLY within a few hours and makes your entire house smell bad when you use it again.Major Con: Mine suddenly just stopped working. I contacted Tineco, they had me send it back, and it's been almost 2 months and I haven't received it back yet. They keep saying it's packed and ready to be shipped, but a label hasn't been made. I'm starting to feel like they stole it. I have no sense when it will be returned to me.

  I’m a Virgo. Cleaning is my love language. I love a clean house but when it came to cleaning floors I use to DREAD it with every part of my being.My kitchen, laundry, and bathrooms on the first floor are all tile. My home office, formal dining, and living room are all hard wood hand scraped flooring.Old way of cleaning consisted of 2 hours of vacuuming every area and then another 2 hours of me mopping every surface and changing mopping pads every few rooms because they’d get soggy and gross.This Tineco is a life changer. I was able to clean every room mentioned above in 45 minutes and that was only because I got so excited I moved every bit of furniture to REALLY clean!Pros: Self Cleaning - SO EASY to use. One cap of cleaner , fill with water and go! It’s cordless and light which is every persons dream when trying to clean and move around large areas. Super easy to clean after each use. I feel good knowing I can maintain this investment because I can clean every working part quickly and without tools. I have ALOT of hair and I was concerned this wouldn’t stand up to the suction needed for my bathrooms. Not only did it get every piece of hair, it DID NOT collect on the roller (which is my major issue with a standard vacuum). It collects all debris and hair into the container and although super disgusting to clean afterwards - it was a huge indication to me that this machine means business. Lastly it uses just the right amount of water and suction depending on how dirty the floors are. The machine automatically detects this for you so all you have to do is be there to guide it as it cleans. It has some serious power so be ready to feel like you’re walking a small dog as this things GOES!Cons: it won’t last too long on a charge so be prepared to clean every room you need to at once. I share this as a tip because it takes a VERY long time to get back to full charge. I used up 70% of the battery power but was ok with that because I got everything done I needed to!The only other con I have is that you should be ready to get a hobby or something because you will definitely have ALOT of time left on your hands. So be ready to find another plan for the remainder of your day. HahahaI am beyond excited about this Tineco and hope you get this ASAP if you want a fast way to keep your hard floors clean.

   Tineco has the absolute worst customer service.  I bought this from a recommendation but out of the box the water wasn't coming out and cleaning like it's supposed to. I have been emailing this company for 4 days trying to figure out what to do. It's ridiculous. They don't have a live chat their phone number just goes to a voice mail which cuts you off  after 10 seconds. For how expensive this product is there is no excuse. I will not be recommending, I'm sure it's a great product when it works but good luck if something goes wrong.

  First let me say I absolutely LOVE my tineco. I use it multiple times a day since I do daycare and have so many little ones during the day.However the battery quit charging in November and I had just gotten it in May. I paid for the 3 year protection plan and reached out to tineco. They said the would pay for return shipping so they could fix it and send it back. They said they would reimburse me up to $25 for shipping materials. I took it to FedEx which is where the shipping label was for and the shipping materials were $27. It took a week for them to respond about my reimbursement which now they are saying they will only reimburse $10. It's been over a month since my first email with customer service and I still don't have the tineco back, nor do I have any updates on repairs or tracking for it coming back. Repairs were supposed to take 2-3 days and it's been over a week yet again.

  I bought a tinico Floor one s3 and a bissel crosswave max – both were awful for different reasons but these have a lot more work that needs to be done before these are useful to anyone. I can’t believe the cost of these machines, they don’t work!!! Not worth it, there is so much hype online about these machines and they are a total let down.The Tinico will not get anywhere close to any edge, we are talking a full inch or more of dirty edges. Why even bother with this if you then have to get a normal mop and mop all of the edges and around everything. The Tinico does an ok job on flat open floor space but that's it!!! Who’s house doesn’t have anything to mop around? It won't get near baseboards or transition strips you can’t use it on any uneven surface. Just a total waste of money.This product must have been designed for people who never walk in their houses and don’t own anything and definitely don’t own pets or children, or a husband.The bissel crosswave max what a complete waste of money! It doesn’t’ vacuum worth a dang and all it does is spread dirt around and it cost even more than the Tinico!!! The Tinico at least cleaned nice open flat areas! The bissel doesn’t even do that!!! Just dirty nasty water everywhere a complete mess and the one they sent me wouldn’t do the self-clean cycle at all I went through all of the videos trying to figure out why it wouldn’t work the thing was defective from the very start for how much these machines cost  I expect all the features to work!!!Complete waste of money and can’t recommend these to anyone!!!

  I loved the ease of cleaning with this. It doesn’t scrub well for stuck on stuff but everyday cleaning was great. Until less than 6 months in it had a motor failure and stopped working entirely.Update - they sent me another one and it died again. Total waste of time and money. I asked for my money back from the company and they said that they can only give me a 62% return minus freight costs… It’s not my problem that their product is crap. If you Google it you will see that there are many issues now with the motor failing. Amazon says it’s Tineco’s problem. Don’t purchase you’ll be out hundreds of dollars.

    I wanted to love my Tineco, but I’m so disappointed
  
","









  
  
    
  As the title says, I desperately wanted to love this Tineco. I own a BISSELL crosswave so I’m familiar with using a vacuum/mop in one. I switched to a Tineco because I’ve heard so many great things about them. I wanted a cordless one and I loved that you can change the suction level from auto to max. Overall the Tineco seemed like a better made, better functioning product. For the first two weeks it worked perfectly. I had a couple issues but nothing major. When I took it out of the box and was looking over it, I realized the little rubber piece on the bottom had a cut in it. As far as I could tell it didn’t effect the way it functioned, just something I noticed. I’ve included a picture so you can see what I’m talking about. The other issue, it wouldn’t recognize the charging base. I’d have to remove the Tineco and replace it a couple times before it would connect and show that it’s charging. This randomly fixed itself after a few days. I didn’t change anything, but it started connecting immediately, no problems. Other than those few things I was obsessed with this machine. It cleaned my floors so well. It did leave them a bit more damp than the crosswave, but it cleaned much better so no big deal! I’ve been very diligent about cleaning it and routine maintenance. Suddenly a few days ago the dirty water tank started leaking. While running it, water has started to come from around the bottom of the dirty water tank. I circled this in a picture to show where it comes from. It doesn’t happen all the time, so I thought the rubber seal wasn’t connecting properly or maybe I didn’t put the tank in well enough, but nothing I’ve tried seems to change when it does or doesn’t happen. It’s also started to leave a streak of water from the left side of roller. I thought it was from the cut in the rubber, but it’s not since that’s on the opposite side. I’ve checked to make sure there’s nothing on the roller or something caught at the bottom. I just can’t figure it out. It seems to make more of a mess now, because I go back to suck up the excess water only for it to leave another streak further left. I expected more than 2 weeks worth of use for such a big price tag.

    Fabulous vacuum!  Best hardwood floor vacuum!

  Oh my gosh…I honestly was a little worried about spending so much, but it is worth EVERY penny.  I have used it for about a month and I am still so impressed.  It is easy to use, cleans the best of any vacuum I have ever owned.  Makes taking care of your hardwood floors so easy.  I bought the spin mop and was exhausted and it took so long…granted, it costs a lot less…but this does the sweeping and the mopping in one…really can’t say enough good things…LOVE this floor cleaner!

  Piece of crud. The battery is good for 300 charges on average.

  At first I thought this vacuum was great, next use, not so much. I have concrete, LVP and tile. Great on concrete, LVP… not horrible, tile? I just gave up and realized I missed my return window 😤 def selling and getting another Bissell. It has zero scrub, the brush is like wiping with wet dusting with a microfiber. So if you actually wanted to mop, forget it. Now seeing you can’t replace the battery on a $400 mop vac, absolutely not. That’s beyond a fail in design.

  Wow, I really appreciate my friend recommending me to buy this vacuum cleaner.I am a person who is afraid of trouble. But this thing is too good, so I still want to share this product.  Although the vacuum cleaner weighs 10 pounds.This is where I hesitate to buy it. But my friend told me not to worry about it, because it is as simple as driving.  When I received the product, it was really easy to install and use. Wet and dry mopping can solve the problem of cleaning the floor at one time. Now, I love mopping the floor because it saves time and is fast.Let my family, especially children, play on the clean floor every day. The cleaning liquid delivered by the vacuum cleaner is also very useful.

    Thorough clean from a clean freak!
  
","









  
  
    
  So I was planning to buy the Bissel Crosswave, but the Tineco iFloor3 was on sale so I sprung for it instead. And I have to say I am very happy that I bought it. I've named her Flo because she is simply amazing and deserves the honor of a name. I have vinyl plank through may whole house which is about 1900ish square feet. I do have some area rugs and the master has carpet, but other than that vinyl. I am a clean freak so I do go around the baseboards and sweep anything out from the wall to be completely sure I get everything picked up, but other than that no other sweeping or vacuuming before I use her. Flo did an amazing job of picking everything up, and there were some pretty big chunks of gravel by the back door. I have mopped for years using a shark steam mop, but my floors were so much cleaner after one use with Flo. My husband even commented that the floors looked cleaner so that is pretty huge! I will also say that this weekend my kids were playing in the mud and dirt and tracked it into my house and then left a ton of dirt and gravel in my tiled master shower floor. So I get Flo out to clean up the kitchen and bathroom floor and it donned on me that the shower floor is tiled so she can clean that too! She cleaned that shower in just a few minutes and my grout looks better than after I get down on my hands and knees and scrub it. (We have red clay in the yard, and light gray grout.) So I would say the overall use of the machine was very easy and takes a time consuming chore and cuts it literally in half. The clean cycle is very easy and requires a little bit of effort to do the maintenance properly, but isn't overwhelmingly complicated. The only thing I don't like is when my hair gets stuck in the dirty water cup and I have to pull it out, I hate touching wet hair, but I prefer this to using a traditional mop or the steam mop at this point. I will say you have to make sure you get the top back on the dirty water tank securely or it will not fit back into the vacuum properly and it took me a second to see where I did not have it lined up correctly. Other than that I haven't had any issues using it. I personally would recommend this vacuum to anyone, but I also think that you should do some research and learn about the product and the  maintenance so you have a realistic expectation since it is much different than any other mop I have used. Like any vacuum that requires maintenance for the filters and such the cleaning maintenance will have to be done after every use, which I don't find it to be hard, but I feel like the complaints that I have seen from others was due to not liking that maintenance process, or not doing it properly and having issues due to that. I would also like to add that I should really be getting commission from Tineco because I posted about Flo on my Facebook account and I have had 3 people buy one due to that post, and have had several more tell me they are planning to buy one soon!

    A great little vac/mop
  
","









  
  
    
  I have used this vac/mop a lot since purchasing it. It works great and gets the floors clean, it's easy to use and lightweight. My only criticism is it gets smelly after a few uses if I don't take it apart and really give it a good cleaning. It is self cleaning and I use that feature a lot, still gets smelly after a few uses. It's fairly easy to take apart and clean and put back together. The only real complaint I have is it is made in China. If made in the U. S. I would have felt better about this purchase.

  I have a lot of non carpeted areas in my house. I originally wanted the Bissel Crosswave but saw a side by side video of the two and the tineco did a better job at removing the dirt. It also gets really close to the base boards so you don't even have to pull out the broom. There is a ""max"" mode the seems to suck a little harder so I use that in my high traffic areas. Its so quick to just pull this out and clean up that I actually don't mind cleaning. Finally, the charging matt has attachments to sit different utensils and the filter and mop head to dry after cleaning.

    Not very useful/unusable  for several reasons
  
","









  
  
    
  I bought this based on the high reviews and the promotion (still cost $300). However, I found this vacuum not very useful if one has more than two rooms: granted it's fun to use but unusable for a moderate size house: the battery lasts only about 30 minutes, the vacuum stops and asks to do soft cleaning, to clean the dirty water tank, every 10 minutes or less even for a not so dirty room. I am not sure whether it is designed so or malfunctioning. The water tank and dirty water tank are cute but very small to do any significant work.  I am considering to return it.

  Ok I bought one of these about a year ago or so. Worked great for the first few months but then it would stop hooking up to the stand up charger. After a while you would have to wiggle them to connect only for it to stop connecting. Company was good, sent another then it stopped sucking up water and leaving it mostly wet. I could not figure out why, I switched out all the parts on it to see if the plastic was leaking or if the filter was clogged, nothing worked.  The charge base on the second one is doing much the same thing on the first but not as bad. They did a light modification to the 2 points of connection but it’s not ideal. If they would just build a battery that would come out instead of this built in nonsense it would be SO MUCH BETTER. I have not bothered to contact the company again for another unit. I am in the market AGAIN for another wet vac.

  This product will make you realize how nasty your floors really are!! We have luxury vinyl floors in our whole house and I can always see dirt on them. I feel like no matter how much I sweep or mop they’re dirty. Well I didn’t realize how dirty until I got this! When I dump the water out it’s pretty much black! 🤢🤢 It’s embarrassing to even admit that. But for the first time since getting this type of floor I can walk on it barefoot and it feels clean! I don’t have dirt or other things sticking to my feet! If you run it on high it uses the water pretty fast and the battery dies before I can do our whole house. On regular mode they both last a good while. I will never own a different type of product to clean my floors! Plus it’s so easy and convenient to clean up a spill when our boys spill some milk or juice. Or when our yorkie comes in from outside and leaves paw prints everywhere!

  I have had the Tineco for 5 months now. I use it at least twice a week to clean my whole downstairs (around 800 sq ft). That space is split between hardwood and tile. I love this thing! As far as mopping goes, I have not been able to find better. We have 3 large dogs that are in and out of the house all day and this thing cleans up after them no problem. I do still vacuum before using this as it does not do well as a full on vacuum, not with the shedding our dogs do anyways. If I were to use it every day, it would be fine, but if I skip a day or two and there is a decent amount of dog hair, it is more work to try and use just this than it is to do a quick vacuum first. The roller will load with hair and you will have to do a ""self clean"" multiple times. If you don't have tumbleweeds of dog hair you need to suck up, this thing alone will do the job. I am able to clean my whole downstairs on one battery charge and I usually only have to stop to empty the dirty water canister and fill the clean water canister once during my clean. The dirt this thing picks up, I can't believe I used to push it around with a mop and think it was clean. I would definitely recommend!

  Worked great…for a year. One year to the day that I ordered this product and it now has a motor failure fault. I’ve used it about 20 times over the past year and only on the downstairs portion of my home so it certainly has not been run hard. The customer service phone number will not allow you to actually speak with anyone so I’m left only writing an email, we shall see in time whether or not they respond and I will update this review according to how this is handled.For the time being, save your money. It works decently when it actually does work but for $400 it certainly should not be a disposable device with a one year life span. Go buy the Bissell equivalent from some where like Bed Bath and Beyond so you can return it to a real person should you have issues.

    Handy but not the best for deep clean

  Love that I can mop/vacuum in one step but there are some pros and cons. Overall, I will keep and use about once every 1-2 weeks.Pros: mop/vac at same time. Great for kitchen, especially with messy kidsLong battery life on auto setting, can easily get my whole house done (about 2000 sq ft.)Cordless so don’t have to plug/unplug a lot.Pretty easy to operate. Pushes very easily across floor.Cons: not my fave for “quick” cleans. I like my shark vac/mop for that.Runs out of clean water before even 50% battery used.Doesn’t get up to edges of walls well.A lot of work to clean tanks, rollers, filters.Doesn’t do great with cleaning really stuck on mess.Still need to deep clean with separate vacuum and mop once in a while.Sometimes leaves a little mess when stopped where the roller sits.

    Floors so clean you can eat off of them
  
","









  
  
    
  This will be the cleanest you could ever get your floors. The first time I used it I went over my kitchen very thoroughly to get a deep clean, dark dirty water came up off of it and I mopped regularly with a Norwex. The floor panels were cleaner than they would be coming out of the box from the store. I have never seen my floors that clean since moving here. I thought my floors looked clean after mopping before this, but it is a huge difference.Tips: I don’t use the chemical soap it came with because it stinks and smells toxic. I use a little bit of seventh generation dish soap and vinegar with hot water in the reservoir, I shake it just a little to get a little bit of suds, too many suds will tell you that you need more water when you don’t, though you can ignore that alert. If I want to disinfect the roller or floors I will add drops of oregano oil into the reservoir.I take the brush roller out each time and clean it good with soap before the self clean, I just want to make sure it’s super clean and doesn’t start harboring bacteria. It takes an extra minute.

  I am 200% OCD. I have 2 cats and a yorkie male  I have all hardwood and laminate floors. I’m in love with this vacuum. It is perfect. I’m getting older and do not have a lot of time to clean lately due to work and the pandemic (healthcare) but this vacuum gets it all. Dust, hair, dirt and debris. It lets you know if the floor needs to be stay in a spot to for it to fully clean. It’s an all in one step. Vacuum and mop and shine and deodorize all in one. Time saver. Back saver (self propelled). My husband video called me just so he could see my face light up during the first time I used it. I’m amazed. I’m delighted I’m a huge fan. Expensive yes. But honestly to me saving my back and my sanity from always having to clean the floors and dragging out different machines and stuff to just this one is a game changer. And it talks. So I love her. She’s a great cleaning buddy. Actually the best.

  I was debating between the Bissell and the Tineco. We have short haired pets that shed everywhere, 3 long haired girls that shed everywhere, and a baby that is constantly throwing food on thr ground. We recently began a kitchen remodel and just got the floors done. I swept and used our swiffer mop on the floor last night. I opened my brand new Tineco this morning and went over our floors and I can't explain how disgusted I was. Goes to show that my floors where not getting cleaned with the swiffer. The self cleaning feature is rather amazing as well. I cleaned the vacuum before doing the self cleaning option and it came out just as dirty as the first time I cleaned the floors. I will be using this amazing thing everyday. I was able to get all my floors done with one charge and in half the time it would have taken me with sweeping and mopping.

  Tineco iFLOOR3 Cordless Wet Dry Vacuum Cleaner, Lightweight, One-Step Cleaning for Hard Floors was better than I expected. The amount of cleaning and vacuuming it does at the same time was great. It got all the pet hair as well. The bottle of cleaner that comes with the unit worked great as well. Only one cap full at a time. It moves easily from room to room as well. When I'm done I easily rinse out all the parts and put it back on it's docking station for next time.

  Amazing product. Not for all type of hardfloor. It doesn’t performance at 100% on floors with small tiles (12inch X 12inch each tile).Limited use for large floors because of water capacity.Other than that we love it!

  I’m in love with cleaning again!  Best vacmop ever. My floors are their original color again. Knew they were dirty, but had no idea they were as bad as they were. Took 30 min to clean about 1500 sq ft wood and tile floors. Everything about this vacmop is perfect. It even has a self cleaning cycle when it’s done.

    Both Machine and Customer Service Broke

  Within six months my machine broke. Attempted to call customer service regarding warranty and told basically I was dumb. Called back again a few months later as the machine is working even worse now and again customer service told me I was dumb and a liar. Unfortunately, I will be going back to my trusty mop and bucket that won’t tell me I’m dumb. This was a very expensive waste of time.

  My husband bought me this as a surprise ans im not exaggerating when i say my floors have NEVER been cleaner.  I mop the floors once a week and have a little iRobot that vacuums but even after a week of a pet free home and being very conscious about my cleaning, i used this vacuum and it was disgusting how much it still cleaned up.  It doesn’t get as close to the baseboards as I’d like, but beggars can’t be choosers.  I literally clean my floors for fun now.  I get comments on how clean it is all the time.  WELL WORTH THE MONEY!

  I have a horse farm and two German Shepard’s. Needless to say I could clean my floors everyday, this purchase will make that happen. I was apprehensive about the company’s recommendations about having to keep all the parts clean but it was very easy to do. I couldn’t believe what it picked up! The self cleaning mode is a great feature. I was able to do one very large room and two smaller ones before I ran out of battery time and refilled twice with cleaning solution and water. Truly very happy with this machine!
